../../input/johnoliver/wav/00114.wav|full-frontal recently did giveaways and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00115.wav|in itself a joke greener under my wiener
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00116.wav|makes it so strange that it passed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00117.wav|provides valuable services from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00118.wav|that the internet and email mean that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00121.wav|asked Congress for a total of billion

../../input/johnoliver/wav/00124.wav|a and third it isn't cutting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00126.wav|that we can do here because the purchase
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00128.wav|will tell you there were a few issues
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00129.wav|get email now it's hard to decide what I
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00130.wav|packages to the Postal Service for the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00131.wav|and this wouldn't be completely out of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00133.wav|you know it's depressing that the

../../input/johnoliver/wav/00143.wav|there's a lot wrong with that but he is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00144.wav|close together but look postal banking
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00145.wav|money by putting price caps on major
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00146.wav|largely unnoticed at the time and with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00147.wav|an estimated million people lack
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00150.wav|stopped delivering gutbusters like that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00152.wav|nice thing that's our show thank you so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00153.wav|stamp and support the Postal Service if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00154.wav|interrupt every tick-tock video in fact
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00156.wav|question why the would I ever send
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00158.wav|that despite being part of the federal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00160.wav|realize that the answer to the question
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00161.wav|thousand jobs and the fact they were so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00165.wav|making things very difficult for postal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00166.wav|and check cashing that wouldn't just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00168.wav|surprisingly wide variety of needs
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00169.wav|with another existential threat the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00170.wav|able to bend the Postal Service to his
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00172.wav|is hated by the president who as we know
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00173.wav|used to be able to send live baby chicks
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00174.wav|rural areas in particular a post office
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00175.wav|really work and again
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00176.wav|work and many people really rely on it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00177.wav|bipartisan support and the effect was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00178.wav|their and what many conservatives would
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00179.wav|hole so the truth is the Postal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00181.wav|bring mail to every single household
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00182.wav|census year and a pandemic that has
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00183.wav|better that's a cake on a cake right
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00184.wav|favorite and now a stamp you can buy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00185.wav|the internet to clarify you can download
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00186.wav|but the word priority stretched over
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00188.wav|workers right now as you probably know
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00189.wav|fashion line although as this youtuber
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00190.wav|regular thing you have to wonder why the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00191.wav|makes from services and postage that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00192.wav|aggressive obligation to set aside over
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00193.wav|profitable and in all likelihood
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00194.wav|okay first what second excuse me it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00195.wav|to and because of the ongoing pandemic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00196.wav|this is the funniest rock of all time
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00197.wav|Enhancement Act of but look
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00198.wav|bought mine and I've got to say it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00199.wav|might help explain why over the years
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00200.wav|underbanked communities who are often
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00202.wav|everything else we've already discussed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00203.wav|attitude towards rural Americans the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00206.wav|funniest things about it is how
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00207.wav|bizarre partnership with forever
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00208.wav|postal service may be about to go broke
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00209.wav|because this guy has strongly opposed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00211.wav|like former Fox News commentator John
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00212.wav|law called the postal accountability and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00213.wav|people together just listen to this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00214.wav|that's plural meaning you've done it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00217.wav|there keep crushing tic TOCs you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00218.wav|unsee it but they took it out because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00219.wav|that simply says lace-making
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00220.wav|also those remote addresses that they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00221.wav|Americans have relied on it for a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00222.wav|dog look like it's performing a postal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00223.wav|USPS to price parcel delivery below its
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00224.wav|main product which may actually help
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00225.wav|but the truth is it does very important
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00226.wav|Rock right there if the Postal Service
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00227.wav|those package delivery costs will almost
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00228.wav|to queer I Geraldo Rivera but it didn't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00229.wav|place now in hindsight he seems like a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00230.wav|you're always there the point is at the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00232.wav|that appointment has worried worried
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00234.wav|over a thousand postal workers have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00235.wav|also limited its flexibility to raise
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00236.wav|American Idol sold stamps and veep and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00237.wav|only should we be demanding that they

../../input/johnoliver/wav/00239.wav|will any of us die today LMFAO and those
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00240.wav|want a sympathy goose I mean sure your
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00241.wav|you hated it buy one anyway and mail me
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00243.wav|the way of the USPS getting the federal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00244.wav|USPS may not make it past September
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00245.wav|even transporting it to the bottom of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00246.wav|without significant service
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00247.wav|sweetheart deals to lose money on every
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00248.wav|because their companies they don't give
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00249.wav|have such severe quarantine brain I
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00250.wav|that law made it illegal for the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00251.wav|offer now experts suggest that the post
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00253.wav|this one that says the grass is greener
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00254.wav|button this is very important you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00255.wav|that in itself was a massive burden to

../../input/johnoliver/wav/00258.wav|incorrect assumption that email is a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00260.wav|actually get stamps made TV shows have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00261.wav|there might actually be something small
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00263.wav|can't actually download medicine from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00264.wav|Postal Service should not get federal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00266.wav|especially during an election year a

../../input/johnoliver/wav/00269.wav|take this one of an orange cat involved
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00270.wav|clips now isn't that they're in black
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00271.wav|that it required was for the USPS to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00272.wav|as their income was basically locked in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00273.wav|but did you know that for years they're
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00274.wav|Service quadruples prices on companies
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00275.wav|access to broadband internet or the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00276.wav|national treasure the Postal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00277.wav|explain some of their very weird side
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00278.wav|also used to be a swastika hidden in the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00279.wav|government agencies are just naturally
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00280.wav|right that FedEx is pretty good at
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00281.wav|and turkeys which actually raises the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00282.wav|so tonight we thought it might be worth
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00283.wav|Service badly needs we've actually been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00284.wav|innovating for example you've probably
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00286.wav|get that Congress should also take a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00288.wav|or someone's microwaving fish again not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00289.wav|laced stamp I'm just worried it might be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00290.wav|certainly be passed on to the consumer
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00291.wav|generator for them and and you can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00292.wav|Stossel hold it up as a sign that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00293.wav|even the recession in fact it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00294.wav|neighborhood dogs keep dying and why
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00295.wav|thing is there are absolutely solutions
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00296.wav|it's often tried to encourage stamp
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00297.wav|still can the Postal Service will
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00298.wav|last leg of the delivery especially in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00299.wav|one of Jeff Bezos his dick pics and the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00301.wav|too cool and you might think that you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00302.wav|generate revenue it could also help the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00303.wav|mail out its rocks like this one that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00304.wav|from seeing stories like these I am very
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00305.wav|fear of dying honestly at this point I
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00306.wav|through the mail and guess what you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00307.wav|actually predates the founding of this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00309.wav|fears are not misplaced
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00310.wav|of stamps is still a key revenue
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00311.wav|you may have noticed FedEx and UPS
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00312.wav|help themselves but for all the reasons
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00313.wav|definitely funnier in person one of the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00316.wav|of that is great I want that woman to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00317.wav|Service went from reporting a net income
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00318.wav|those stegosauruses are standing way too
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00321.wav|is this about me
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00322.wav|nothing doper than a totally bitchin
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00323.wav|year including close to % of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00324.wav|turning a profit we're not for a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00325.wav|shouldn't do that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00326.wav|selling money orders money transfers and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00327.wav|is clearly more of a long-term solution
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00328.wav|hats it's that everyone is standing next
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00329.wav|everywhere and I say there's simply

../../input/johnoliver/wav/00332.wav|Washington Post whose political coverage

../../input/johnoliver/wav/00344.wav|businesses have to innovate

../../input/johnoliver/wav/00380.wav|could wake up in the Jurassic period and

../../input/johnoliver/wav/00398.wav|institution is on the brink of collapse
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00401.wav|like what would happen if someone tried

../../input/johnoliver/wav/00456.wav|few years back they entered into a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00457.wav|one thing we know nixon was not a fan of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00460.wav|he could as he's repeatedly indicated

../../input/johnoliver/wav/00463.wav|population of california
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00464.wav|only as much and it's clearly not

../../input/johnoliver/wav/00467.wav|amy coney barrett is only and i know
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00471.wav|insinuations there including
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00472.wav|their party's blatant hypocrisy by

../../input/johnoliver/wav/00477.wav|representation whatsoever
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00478.wav|any more than the national archives gave
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00480.wav|is currently trying to take towards jk
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00481.wav|though that is less than the total
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00482.wav|by refusing to even consider merrick
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00483.wav|confidence in government
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00485.wav|national popular vote began picking up

../../input/johnoliver/wav/00489.wav|vote in four out of the last five
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00490.wav|looks like a merkin but look let's talk

../../input/johnoliver/wav/00493.wav|think own netflix now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00495.wav|in fact when a movement to switch to a

../../input/johnoliver/wav/00498.wav|manage to find this stock footage titled
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00499.wav|so we've got to fight for basically who
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00500.wav|ii with stars on the flag america is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00502.wav|the supreme court is about to lurch to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00503.wav|worry i'm strong as mule piss
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00506.wav|it's going to hurt for a long time for a

../../input/johnoliver/wav/00509.wav|already seem to be freaking out the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00510.wav|of mules urinating although we did
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00511.wav|mitch mcconnell and his mule piss for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00512.wav|but republicans will fiercely defend it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00513.wav|there are other ideas for significant
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00514.wav|three-fifths this time at this rate they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00515.wav|really just those two things and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00516.wav|committing to blocking a justice
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00517.wav|and even if they then get rid of the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00519.wav|lot of people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00521.wav|that would not only help balance out the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00522.wav|reforms such as setting term limits for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00523.wav|alcohol two more years and she'll have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00527.wav|court again they could now easily go the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00530.wav|at all in fact if you take all of this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00531.wav|the electoral college will work one more
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00533.wav|that have republican senators even
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00534.wav|the populations are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00535.wav|almost four million americans who
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00536.wav|i do not like him eating cheeses i hate
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00537.wav|the better way to abolish the electoral
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00538.wav|the right thing to do for the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00539.wav|kill it in the cradle
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00540.wav|golden nuggets unless you're talking
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00542.wav|attention and the older one looks like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00543.wav|we'll tell you which direction the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00544.wav|slow dignified process
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00546.wav|can distort the will of the majority on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00547.wav|say they align with the democratic party
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00548.wav|i do not like his backward views i do
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00549.wav|one of the bedrock institutions of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00550.wav|representing million people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00551.wav|could be dire in recent years key cases
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00553.wav|specify how many seats there should be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00554.wav|and some republicans seem to rationalize
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00556.wav|center wrong look this has been a very
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00558.wav|currently have no senatorial
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00559.wav|federal judiciary
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00561.wav|refuse to concede
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00563.wav|appropriate times
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00564.wav|serve for a long time
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00566.wav|justifiably got a lot of attention but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00567.wav|mcconnell apparently had this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00568.wav|and that has led some to suggest taking
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00569.wav|as much as it's been hit by an asteroid
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00570.wav|would be to think that that has in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00571.wav|other way and there is clearly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00572.wav|in the middle of his tiger-themed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00573.wav|for judicial appointments was perhaps
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00575.wav|wow that is extraordinary
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00576.wav|support with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00577.wav|until it collapsed in on itself like a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00578.wav|fight world war
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00579.wav|it's also
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00580.wav|if there are six things we know he
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00581.wav|mcconnell's blockade of merrick garland
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00582.wav|that should be impossible to argue with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00583.wav|would be i think they want us to work
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00584.wav|we added two states in we didn't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00585.wav|winner-take-all approach in most states
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00586.wav|fewer people than the democratic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00587.wav|regions of the country
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00588.wav|and force the result into the courts and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00589.wav|that which is undeniably chilling
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00591.wav|conservative something which is even
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00592.wav|obvious at the time in fact
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00593.wav|favorite fall lasagna ingredients and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00594.wav|to fight tirelessly and with every tool
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00596.wav|what the hell are you talking about mitt
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00598.wav|campaign volunteers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00599.wav|also explained to woodward i'm going to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00600.wav|dicaprio's girlfriend gains the right to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00603.wav|lower court appointees so a future
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00605.wav|rather than less because the unavoidable
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00606.wav|presidency nor the senate are nearly as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00607.wav|republicans like kevin mccarthy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00608.wav|because for the record more americans
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00610.wav|conservative supreme court striking them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00611.wav|jews blacks hippies snitches living
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00612.wav|as much representation as the average
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00613.wav|that you know what mitch's biggest thing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00617.wav|garland in an election year because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00618.wav|and if voters there wanted puerto rico
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00620.wav|how the we got here and what the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00621.wav|but obviously we didn't end up doing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00622.wav|which is just astonishing that's roughly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00623.wav|of government for the foreseeable future
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00624.wav|half people everywhere
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00625.wav|anything because there is no point
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00626.wav|would be because it doesn't take a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00627.wav|deeply undemocratic nature
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00628.wav|rid of the electoral college which might
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00629.wav|but needless to say obama very much
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00630.wav|there are real concerns about what the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00631.wav|people involved here because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00632.wav|the father seems to be reading it to his
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00633.wav|should be abolished that would allow
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00635.wav|children which is objectively
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00636.wav|not like his stupid suits
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00637.wav|in fact obama's only ever given trump
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00638.wav|conversation with the president
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00641.wav|legislation to get passed with a simple
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00642.wav|to move her belongings out of his house
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00643.wav|first of all you kevin if there is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00644.wav|dark week for a lot of people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00646.wav|okay first it's weird to refer to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00647.wav|efforts making what is in retrospect
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00648.wav|thing to come out of kentucky more
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00650.wav|mitch mcconnell began systematically
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00651.wav|nothing should be taken lightly here
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00652.wav|voters in some of the least populous
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00653.wav|as they are suggesting there first take
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00654.wav|should they confirm trump's nominee
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00656.wav|trump wants marvel's to bob woodward
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00659.wav|preserving daca to striking down an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00660.wav|donkey who urine at sunset and i have to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00661.wav|which we've argued before we should
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00662.wav|change we've argued before that the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00663.wav|nicholas cage the declaration of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00664.wav|that is young for a supreme court
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00665.wav|addressed so tonight let's talk about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00666.wav|cooperation or indeed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00667.wav|outweigh the potential for a court with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00670.wav|so the fact is when barrett is confirmed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00672.wav|constantly shifting and granting dc and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00673.wav|it's rigged in a way that has allowed a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00674.wav|it's a travesty we're at the end
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00675.wav|makes it pretty clear that for trump
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00676.wav|time is amazing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00677.wav|you truly are an inspiration to hispanic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00679.wav|now as for the presidency we have to get
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00680.wav|to use it to make significant structural
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00681.wav|never-ending cycle of both parties doing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00682.wav|at kfc we promise
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00683.wav|i will think of that donkey who you're
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00684.wav|a mandate to do exactly what they're
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00685.wav|do i do not like that man ted cruz
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00686.wav|could fill the seats later so obama
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00687.wav|party without popular support
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00688.wav|angry white people wearing red hats
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00689.wav|steam a decade ago
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00690.wav|here overnight and we won't get out of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00691.wav|that has enabled them to do what they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00692.wav|a democrat has won the national popular
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00693.wav|right and as someone who has lived
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00694.wav|facebook posts from undercover russian
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00695.wav|unacceptable and unnecessary wager that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00696.wav|kavanaugh hearings because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00697.wav|mcconnell's willingness to go to the map
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00699.wav|steps that would make both the senate
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00700.wav|a solid majority say the winner of this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00702.wav|upholding the affordable care act to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00703.wav|gutted the voting rights act is a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00704.wav|actually is in the internet is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00705.wav|fighting fire with fire is not enough
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00706.wav|is this man mitch mcconnell the only
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00707.wav|justice and look if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00708.wav|selling trump coloring books that even
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00709.wav|for our climate health care and civil
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00710.wav|harvey weinstein was still producing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00711.wav|hard for democrats to win a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00713.wav|having an additional supreme court
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00714.wav|there are some other steps we could take
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00715.wav|the president they set
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00717.wav|then president nixon even urged congress
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00718.wav|of expanding the supreme court by adding
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00719.wav|you go the books stay now for this idea
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00720.wav|a pretty convincing case there is a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00721.wav|second major factor
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00722.wav|complain about their opponents going to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00725.wav|and made him so furious he decided to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00726.wav|which is a lot but need more which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00729.wav|not remembering like choose your
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00730.wav|setting aside the legal hurdles it would
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00731.wav|star inside a black hole
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00734.wav|crispy cheeto flavored in a warm slurry
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00735.wav|to see his dumb face smirking because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00736.wav|the idea is to picture donald trump
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00737.wav|would be increasingly hard to get and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00738.wav|wasn't a fan of it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00741.wav|but look let's say for the sake of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00742.wav|there is a whole system underneath them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00743.wav|house and both chambers of congress this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00746.wav|also why aren't they coloring in the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00747.wav|the upcoming election the biggest
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00748.wav|concerns the fact that last weekend ruth
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00752.wav|almost certainly face
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00753.wav|choices will have been rubber-stamped
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00754.wav|november which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00755.wav|poll after poll has shown americans
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00756.wav|legislation those laws are now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00757.wav|and to react to what she said with don't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00758.wav|currently controls both the senate and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00759.wav|and almost certainly when barrett is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00760.wav|it is possible the constitution doesn't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00762.wav|the level of james cameron going you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00763.wav|his judges and his obsession isn't just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00764.wav|leaving elections up to chance miss you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00765.wav|the point here is it is past time for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00766.wav|white american and the average hispanic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00767.wav|right trump is about to replace a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00768.wav|well for democrats the first priority is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00769.wav|is four years ago
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00774.wav|the younger kid isn't even paying
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00775.wav|it's leaving elections up to chance and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00776.wav|of america's institutions because there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00778.wav|did we all take a buzzfeed quiz that i'm
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00779.wav|and that brings us to our final question
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00780.wav|of a white person as early as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00781.wav|black american only percent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00783.wav|two major factors that brought us to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00784.wav|distressing enough but it's been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00786.wav|through the exact hypothetical he just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00787.wav|and tactic at our disposal because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00788.wav|and in the past four years leonardo
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00789.wav|it's kind of amazing very basically if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00790.wav|it would need states representing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00791.wav|statehood to washington dc
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00792.wav|with the supreme court
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00793.wav|i do not like his cowboy boots i do not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00794.wav|because it's easy to forget that after
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00795.wav|big change and perhaps that is why
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00796.wav|even privately said this to a group of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00797.wav|would take from america
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00798.wav|places a large
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00801.wav|enough states just pretend the electoral
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00803.wav|supermajority and do anything meaningful
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00804.wav|in the senate where there are states
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00805.wav|you guessed it a filibuster
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00806.wav|immediately after christine blasey
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00807.wav|your representative democracy is hey
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00808.wav|in ways that could take a while to fully
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00809.wav|he's trying to will the coloring book
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00813.wav|that is an impressively strong stream so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00816.wav|the more dramatic step
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00818.wav|representation in the senate
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00823.wav|crucial to his re-election as crucial
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00826.wav|than the kfc menu how do you want your
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00827.wav|compounded by the fact that just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00828.wav|onwards and upwards black people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00829.wav|reflective of the will of the american
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00830.wav|at least black people got above
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00831.wav|by appealing almost exclusively to white
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00832.wav|have been decided by just one vote from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00833.wav|as mitt romney is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00835.wav|away with the electoral college in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00836.wav|of a generational battle and the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00837.wav|wouldn't actually pass muster with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00838.wav|yeah he's right he could absolutely do
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00839.wav|even if the democrats sweep the election
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00840.wav|just get it the done although i
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00843.wav|that was always in bad faith as was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00844.wav|here overnight but we must be willing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00845.wav|ford's gut-wrenching testimony
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00846.wav|that again for structural reasons
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00850.wav|which does make sense because if there's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00852.wav|happened here's birch bai
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00854.wav|those courts have allowed republicans to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00855.wav|that is definitely worth considering
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00856.wav|they basically are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00857.wav|have quietly signed on to an interesting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00858.wav|like him when he sneezes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00859.wav|okay there is a number of dark
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00860.wav|argument democrats do manage to sweep
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00861.wav|honestly seem to think that even if they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00863.wav|you have to fight mule piss
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00864.wav|filibuster
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00866.wav|somehow significantly get more power
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00867.wav|never more obvious than during the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00868.wav|should those issues come before the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00869.wav|every time i think of mitch mcconnell
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00870.wav|nation's electorate leans
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00871.wav|eventual blowback to that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00873.wav|minority and if that sounds absurd to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00874.wav|that got us to where we are now the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00876.wav|because the electoral college with its
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00877.wav|in at sunset
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00879.wav|four more avatar movies and to both of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00880.wav|closer to the will of the country
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00881.wav|conservative justice who's been called
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00882.wav|a president who lost the popular vote
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00883.wav|favor abortion rights with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00884.wav|senate's bias toward white rural voters
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00885.wav|together the senate gives the average
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00888.wav|justice so they can decide
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00889.wav|it is a mistake to focus just on the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00890.wav|republican president
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00892.wav|appointment is absolutely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00893.wav|abolish the electoral college
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00896.wav|is that the system is already rigged and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00897.wav|he's not even trying to hide it now we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00898.wav|disrespect for a chicken's memory
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00899.wav|could count as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00901.wav|leadership and crucially
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00903.wav|center-right
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00906.wav|every four years the american democracy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00908.wav|genius to imagine what republicans would
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00910.wav|government seriously
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00911.wav|yoga naked
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00912.wav|full of sentient nuclear jackhammers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00913.wav|operatives and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00915.wav|doing it too
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00916.wav|into becoming a nintendo switch with his
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00917.wav|american governments now does that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00918.wav|harry potter fan
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00919.wav|like puerto rico and washington dc where
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00920.wav|oh i've got an answer to that question
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00923.wav|that i make look like but trust me
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00924.wav|we've expanded the court before and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00925.wav|support of roe v wade reaching record
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00927.wav|and women's rights
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00928.wav|maximum flavor for you maximum
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00929.wav|we also got here
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00930.wav|just have to be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00931.wav|the female antonin scalia and she could
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00932.wav|a brief tour of the white house and a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00933.wav|trump's rise to power
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00934.wav|and they will argue that this gives them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00935.wav|electoral college had bipartisan support
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00936.wav|given everything we've just discussed is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00937.wav|incredibly restrictive abortion law
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00938.wav|puerto rico statehood or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00939.wav|we've added states before
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00941.wav|court expansion could open the door to a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00942.wav|hellscape and destroy democracy as we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00944.wav|our main story tonight
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00945.wav|and just think about how long four years
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00946.wav|itself fixed everything or indeed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00947.wav|but the next battle has to start right
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00949.wav|now and it will be long we didn't get
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00951.wav|also supports medicare for all oh and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00953.wav|the best way forward is to try and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00954.wav|didn't deliberately leave those
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00955.wav|a little bit by bad luck and bad timing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00956.wav|a single-minded focus for mcconnell
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00957.wav|green new deal i don't care which of you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00959.wav|no problem getting a rental car
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00961.wav|it which could permanently destabilize
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00962.wav|know what people want
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00963.wav|and just give us what we do want
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00964.wav|they'll simply be bringing the court
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00965.wav|mitch mcconnell said republicans need to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00966.wav|supreme court justices
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00967.wav|the population of rhode island maine
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00968.wav|potential workaround
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00969.wav|college would be to do it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00970.wav|because the legislation was ultimately
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00971.wav|there doesn't necessarily require his
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00972.wav|since when is this nation naturally
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00973.wav|those men i say this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00974.wav|bader ginsburg died which was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00975.wav|than the republicans plus
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00977.wav|based on his campaign's online store
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00978.wav|this point the first
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00979.wav|expanding the court is a bit like doing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00981.wav|i wasn't sure how strong mulepis
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00983.wav|simple act of congress although
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00984.wav|seem hopeless right now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00987.wav|representing million
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00988.wav|on the senate side you could grant
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00991.wav|surging to the left against the odds
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00992.wav|win the election outright even if he
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00993.wav|that is not a mandate and it's not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00994.wav|surprisingly short of videos
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00995.wav|those are the only two perfectly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00996.wav|colossal inferiority complex that fueled
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00998.wav|some very big systemic problems which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/00999.wav|you can't it seems the message manchin
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01000.wav|what is frustrating is that some
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01002.wav|is we lost and that hurts
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01003.wav|sound radical
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01004.wav|the movement mcconnell was talking about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01006.wav|it's because to be completely honest
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01008.wav|vacancies open for trump
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01009.wav|this happened good evening we begin with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01011.wav|is both horrendous and deeply weird
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01012.wav|it doesn't take a genius they want to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01013.wav|look bored by what is going on there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01014.wav|as bread because it's all on the table
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01015.wav|is no doubt the republican party
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01016.wav|it's important for us to choose the next
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01018.wav|percent of americans saying we should
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01020.wav|to choose ginsburg's successor so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01021.wav|return to a more civilized
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01023.wav|one more good terminator movie and a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01024.wav|and then have the courage to pass major
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01025.wav|means a certainty not only could trump
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01026.wav|made sure that trump could stack the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01027.wav|which has just two democratic ones and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01031.wav|no one wants that stop talking about it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01032.wav|didn't give trump those judges
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01033.wav|the white house it's true
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01034.wav|it grants disproportionate power to less
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01036.wav|the one wrong way to enjoy a coloring
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01038.wav|extremes to get what they want
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01039.wav|to be bold enough
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01041.wav|getting power unless you're then willing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01043.wav|turn america into an apocalyptic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01044.wav|undoing or blocking years of protections
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01045.wav|you're describing your husband's balls
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01046.wav|totally get it now and going forward
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01048.wav|you even get into the fact that places
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01049.wav|confirmation not just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01050.wav|it's congressional republicans
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01051.wav|when republicans took the senate in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01052.wav|we can possibly do next and there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01054.wav|that is even harder and i will say
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01055.wav|often than it should
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01056.wav|and has been done in the past through a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01058.wav|though i will say
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01059.wav|centrist democrats like joe manchin
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01060.wav|elections but we've spent of the last
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01062.wav|actually make our system more democratic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01063.wav|movies in the past four years
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01064.wav|to sign on it currently has
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01065.wav|and twice i can report that our
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01066.wav|liberal icon with an extremely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01067.wav|yeah that's a republican senator
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01068.wav|to get a justice confirmed before the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01069.wav|admittedly risky especially for a party
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01070.wav|set wildly unpopular policy that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01071.wav|the kids in the ad
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01072.wav|of what can now be done
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01073.wav|that possibility is clearly part of his
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01074.wav|and that is not just dumb that's dumb on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01075.wav|through a constitutional amendment but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01076.wav|it's because it clearly is especially
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01077.wav|to go through with it writing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01079.wav|montana and wyoming combined
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01081.wav|disappear it's the same approach every
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01082.wav|to try and take control of the white
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01085.wav|what the american people choose and that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01087.wav|before it grows up but the beauty is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01090.wav|will have picked a quarter of the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01091.wav|in fact in the late s it very nearly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01092.wav|no point holding on to hope that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01093.wav|which tend to be rural and more
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01094.wav|our country isn't so much center-right
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01095.wav|got married left the royal family and i
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01097.wav|reconfiguring america's courts has been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01099.wav|have done and that brings us to the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01101.wav|for you joe no
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01104.wav|presidential election should be the one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01105.wav|for the foreseeable future and if things
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01106.wav|lower courts with conservative judges
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01107.wav|conservatives might choose to respect
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01108.wav|that mandate because neither the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01109.wav|and even today the idea has widespread
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01110.wav|but it really isn't it's not even a new
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01112.wav|but those very factors make it extremely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01113.wav|rowling obliviate
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01114.wav|one way to dampen your enthusiasm for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01115.wav|blasey ford's testimony
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01117.wav|majority it is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01118.wav|doesn't exist it could functionally
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01119.wav|is in the whole world
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01120.wav|one group of people who don't get to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01121.wav|back then the idea of abolishing the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01122.wav|that specifically
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01123.wav|this is a pivotal moment and what we got
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01124.wav|election because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01126.wav|increasingly vulnerable to a more
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01127.wav|and a third of the supreme court and his
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01130.wav|presidential term
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01131.wav|years
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01132.wav|confirmed to the supreme court the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01136.wav|ahead of the election senator
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01137.wav|largely black or hispanic don't have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01138.wav|the senator who spearheaded those
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01139.wav|in an election year but for an entire
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01140.wav|an act of congress at all because a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01141.wav|by a senate republican majority
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01142.wav|electoral votes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01143.wav|about actual golden nuggets or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01145.wav|but as easy and fun as it is to blame
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01149.wav|funeral while impersonating a priest
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01151.wav|hasn't so much been eroded erosion is a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01152.wav|to drastically reshape an entire branch
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01153.wav|harry and megan began dating got engaged
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01154.wav|kavanagh's confirmation felt a lot less
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01156.wav|set aside the notion that a court that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01157.wav|can expect to be in the minority more
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01158.wav|if you've already filled out your census
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01161.wav|that you'll be done in less than
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01162.wav|had spitzerington to spare
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01164.wav|why not use the time to register to vote
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01165.wav|well i don't know about that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01167.wav|haven't participated basically the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01168.wav|i'm pretty comfortable right now not for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01170.wav|news coming just this week
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01171.wav|show we'll see you next week
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01172.wav|days and a voice that's seen better
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01173.wav|it isn't the census is how the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01175.wav|census you may remember that we covered
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01177.wav|that around million households
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01179.wav|into a -minute show and i'm about to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01180.wav|it on the show last year when we learned
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01182.wav|not only that underneath it we're going
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01185.wav|going to leave you watching this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01187.wav|finally tonight a quick word on the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01188.wav|and if you are one of those people who
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01189.wav|concerning underrepresentation
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01191.wav|sean penn's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01193.wav|underrepresented in congress
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01198.wav|talked about earlier in the show
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01199.wav|mr landlord and it contains lines like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01200.wav|to september th which is in just three
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01201.wav|run from this screen like the wind thank
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01202.wav|funds and given everything that we just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01203.wav|that donald trump thought it was when
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01204.wav|right now because you definitely have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01205.wav|effervescence lived
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01208.wav|overstate how important it is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01210.wav|it could not be more important for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01213.wav|you count how many toilets are in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01215.wav|substitute teacher who fell asleep after
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01218.wav|number of seats each state has in the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01219.wav|census is something everyone should do
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01220.wav|to this website or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01221.wav|to be playing the audiobook version of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01222.wav|glory ended and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01225.wav|house and the distribution of federal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01226.wav|the book has no formal plot a president
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01227.wav|a bit of a with the latest
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01229.wav|minutes but honestly and not to brag
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01230.wav|yeah the deadline for the census was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01232.wav|regardless of when the deadline is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01233.wav|that you do so and it's so easy just go
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01237.wav|and go to mycensus.gov right now and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01243.wav|because for the rest of this show i'm
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01244.wav|on how to do that right here and if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01245.wav|then pointlessly moved forward
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01246.wav|you can find information
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01247.wav|a man with a face that's seen better
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01253.wav|people's houses which you know
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01255.wav|gingivitis you're getting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01256.wav|but some of us aren't putting in the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01258.wav|if you love phone calls for some reason
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01260.wav|two minutes on your hands and the reason
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01262.wav|in her every cellular expression and she

../../input/johnoliver/wav/01266.wav|of a dvd logo bouncing around like a

../../input/johnoliver/wav/01272.wav|screensaver
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01273.wav|i found it took me less than two so why
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01274.wav|the courts will decide whether that's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01275.wav|i know that for sure is we are currently
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01276.wav|bob honey who just do stuff read by its
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01277.wav|government determines things like the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01278.wav|same category
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01279.wav|days and now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01280.wav|it is dreadful so please save yourself
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01281.wav|you've already done both of those things

../../input/johnoliver/wav/01296.wav|the pandemic has become
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01297.wav|actually the deadline or not but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01298.wav|as flossing except instead of getting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01301.wav|it is soon and currently estimates are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01302.wav|donald j trump site and buy this dog
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01305.wav|overstate the level of relief
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01306.wav|he have a lot of body hair or is he
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01308.wav|this is your final notice so far you've
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01309.wav|look i would love to make fun of that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01311.wav|voted for trump meaning they either
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01312.wav|drainpipe into the ocean
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01313.wav|where trump seemed to be behind his
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01314.wav|what's your problem
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01315.wav|jar with a raccoon in it did you eat all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01317.wav|poll watcher who left the room
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01318.wav|georgia in january but the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01322.wav|that some late ballots were being
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01325.wav|to just throw
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01326.wav|straight away and all these pointless
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01327.wav|in the history of the judiciary they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01328.wav|actually make someone look more like a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01330.wav|everyone seemed to immediately forget
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01331.wav|with this moment captured just minutes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01332.wav|that in michigan where he led early on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01333.wav|that this week has managed to provide
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01335.wav|them from counting the votes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01336.wav|like her going forward
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01337.wav|that biden has repeatedly said on the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01338.wav|really nice sentiment but dividing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01339.wav|did not work this time and it's not like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01341.wav|the less good news is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01342.wav|octopuses over footage of people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01344.wav|began to favor biden trump tweeted out
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01345.wav|in delaware sarah mcbride became the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01348.wav|unfortunately that sticker is attached
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01349.wav|hangover hangover divorce and meat sweat
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01350.wav|lawyer said yes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01353.wav|you know what that person screaming
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01355.wav|reform minded prosecutors and sheriffs
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01356.wav|don the vice president and you've even
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01357.wav|race was called
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01358.wav|truly unhinged with him throwing around
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01359.wav|count slowly unfolded because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01360.wav|yeah i saw a guy in a ski mask pulling
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01361.wav|all owned the right to put on our masks
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01364.wav|you've ignored team trump eric lara
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01367.wav|and completely unfounded victory at
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01368.wav|counting had essentially been finished
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01369.wav|ever asked his supporters to do because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01370.wav|and in the midst of all of this the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01371.wav|being disqualified in arizona because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01374.wav|one he's sad right now which is great
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01375.wav|black voters were absolutely key with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01376.wav|showed up in a city that is black to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01377.wav|they should listen to her and activists
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01381.wav|here and be cynical about what a biden
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01382.wav|election just a little bit not much
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01383.wav|be president at the very heart of it and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01384.wav|tonight we thought it might be worth
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01385.wav|you personally i'm going to do one of my
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01386.wav|for the rest of your life
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01388.wav|flying around that trump ballots were
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01390.wav|and national origin has frequently been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01396.wav|nipples look like are you talking hours
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01397.wav|the united states government is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01399.wav|democratic areas and he did so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01400.wav|mystery of can a beard
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01401.wav|this i voted sticker which is great
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01402.wav|defeating trump
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01403.wav|that were still remaining which stood
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01404.wav|presidency could
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01405.wav|have beaks they can open bottles they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01406.wav|aren't going your way
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01408.wav|it's over which in this situation was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01409.wav|the last seven days because at the start
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01410.wav|but wait that's not all the trump
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01412.wav|we need to talk about in the months and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01413.wav|and the judge replied i'm sorry then
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01414.wav|communities from someone trying to do
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01416.wav|in the last years that's incredible
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01417.wav|welcome but on any regular day
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01418.wav|voting as a favor for white people so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01419.wav|the electoral college which is at least
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01421.wav|the desperate pathetic attempts to paint
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01422.wav|complete around at one point
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01425.wav|groups on the same side shouting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01427.wav|and the embarrassing flimsiness of these
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01428.wav|you can simply go to this address
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01430.wav|legitimately jealous of because now i
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01431.wav|long before the results were in he took
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01433.wav|were elected but you sensed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01434.wav|just how scary it felt as it was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01435.wav|it's just not gonna have the same effect
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01437.wav|not how it works calling dibs on states
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01438.wav|shout that they should stop
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01439.wav|it mentions that rather than funding
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01441.wav|going to be different crucially that it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01442.wav|took a lot of work much of it by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01444.wav|having heard a rumor from someone else
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01445.wav|mainly because it is still too early to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01446.wav|specifically oversight foyer requests
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01448.wav|okay there is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01450.wav|america the one sentence version of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01452.wav|never forget it is genuinely hard to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01453.wav|was dating two old guys both of whom
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01454.wav|the years to come and we will
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01455.wav|trespassers out of the white house
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01456.wav|frankly think that we've
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01457.wav|would have been a very different and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01458.wav|in some states trump looked like he was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01459.wav|anymore it's not gonna directly impact
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01460.wav|counting their votes and if you don't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01463.wav|works at the library
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01464.wav|is down to two runoff elections in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01465.wav|corner i'm so glad i was wandering by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01466.wav|will be used to retire debt from trump's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01467.wav|and also not even the worst thing he's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01468.wav|to deny that reality
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01469.wav|ample space for trump and his supporters
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01470.wav|on just how weird it is that one of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01471.wav|of ballots in virginia beach
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01472.wav|watch him do this dance
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01473.wav|let's put seconds on the clock
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01474.wav|that because starting that evening
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01476.wav|making this officially the single
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01477.wav|became the first gay black men elected
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01478.wav|being burned a video that the city
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01479.wav|more patience than usual yet for some
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01480.wav|and there'll be big systemic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01482.wav|and most importantly despite his lies
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01483.wav|trump's twitter timeline
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01486.wav|weren't given access to the ballot
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01487.wav|always done but once he's out of the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01488.wav|trump campaign was loudly announcing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01489.wav|lemon and a philadelphia city
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01490.wav|across america
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01492.wav|was going to require
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01494.wav|in some states to declare a premature
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01495.wav|like the time that they solved the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01496.wav|about what trumpism is going to mean
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01497.wav|now because we had space for a joke here
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01498.wav|found suspicious
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01501.wav|and this isn't just about the last four
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01502.wav|was uncomplicated fun
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01503.wav|a political term of art for election
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01506.wav|and uh actually this is a bit awkward
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01507.wav|state senator multiple counties elected
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01508.wav|a perfect example is this kamala harris
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01509.wav|part of this entire week was that in the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01510.wav|conference set the tone for the rest of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01511.wav|they were counting them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01512.wav|and they learned that if octopuses take
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01514.wav|exchange between don
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01515.wav|just how ridiculous those lawsuits were
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01516.wav|it honestly didn't occur to me to tell
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01521.wav|press conference on thursday that they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01524.wav|to images of pennsylvania-based rat
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01525.wav|day everyone petergate was a or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01526.wav|a judge gives you the judicial
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01527.wav|every state that had a marijuana
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01528.wav|perfectly capable of escorting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01529.wav|not who we are he did it constantly in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01531.wav|or is even going to try to achieve but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01532.wav|expert but i am pretty sure
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01533.wav|here i don't know why i'm even
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01535.wav|are still taking to the streets to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01536.wav|spent the last few days
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01537.wav|end she picks pete who seems decent and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01538.wav|as things dragged on it was clear they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01539.wav|and eric trump tweeted out a fake video
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01540.wav|counted and when the judge pointed out
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01541.wav|trump's presidency is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01542.wav|but for now after what's just happened i
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01543.wav|this website and phone number where they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01544.wav|moments before this race was called on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01545.wav|all caps exclamation mark and if that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01547.wav|he was being interrupted by a walking
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01548.wav|although there are some lessons in some
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01549.wav|complete euphoria
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01550.wav|which looks like he's milking two cows
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01551.wav|something perhaps best summed up by this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01552.wav|i'm starting to focus on the negatives
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01554.wav|them active harm
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01555.wav|anymore something i personally learned
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01556.wav|anyway giuliani's press conference was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01558.wav|the nature of the accusation
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01559.wav|reelection campaign
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01560.wav|they can change shape and color they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01562.wav|coming out for biden and in pennsylvania
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01563.wav|dispensing excellent facts about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01564.wav|hot idiots this was clearly a very long
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01566.wav|advantage of the fact that he was ahead
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01567.wav|the same thing that's why the movie
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01568.wav|is missouri's first black congresswoman
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01569.wav|and everything he said and stands for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01570.wav|from no less than text messages from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01572.wav|that more than million people voted
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01573.wav|shenanigans is rat
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01574.wav|there's even an option to add
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01575.wav|every american's life and that alone is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01576.wav|over analyze everything and i can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01577.wav|claim the state of michigan which is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01578.wav|which was false
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01579.wav|ahead while in others
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01581.wav|pathetic although i do like the idea
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01582.wav|call displayed by that registrar while
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01583.wav|a second trump term
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01585.wav|of that organizing in georgia
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01586.wav|in multiple states trying to cast a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01587.wav|represents is simply
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01589.wav|trump lost this election he lost
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01590.wav|the first south asian american vice
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01592.wav|the end unfortunately that press
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01593.wav|initiative on the ballot approved it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01594.wav|is a shirt but i think my favorite thing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01596.wav|might or might not have been counted
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01597.wav|it's gone on for at least four seasons
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01598.wav|and second they weren't finding ballots
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01600.wav|little bit because they weren't so much
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01602.wav|new zealand aquarium by crawling down a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01604.wav|house no more steve mnuchin
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01608.wav|uh no it's not okay it's not okay at all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01611.wav|this is like house of cards in that it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01613.wav|specifically the judge asked are people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01614.wav|mind i am going to over analyze this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01616.wav|that get out garden party guest is right
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01617.wav|that during a press briefing from a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01618.wav|them to the trump campaign
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01620.wav|led by those with the most to lose from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01621.wav|pennsylvania
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01623.wav|and even in the joy and relief at the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01626.wav|you didn't see them but the claim was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01627.wav|taken also
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01628.wav|but unfortunately
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01629.wav|so given we just did that if you don't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01630.wav|they lost seats in the house and the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01631.wav|joy in whatever form you want dancing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01632.wav|commissioner so how long do you think
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01633.wav|that's it that's it that was time that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01634.wav|unfortunately we did elect a white
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01636.wav|door beats that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01637.wav|trump tweeted out i won this election by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01638.wav|that formed in those three days provided
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01639.wav|with our main story tonight which is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01640.wav|with my three favorite things on it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01641.wav|were comfortable enough with it to vote
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01642.wav|that we are going to have to reckon with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01643.wav|to being inside another what an absolute
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01644.wav|recent star of the borat movie rudy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01645.wav|much shorter movie one nemo
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01646.wav|fantastic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01647.wav|and that is something
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01648.wav|he delivered this nightmarish speech
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01649.wav|consistently inconsistent in their
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01650.wav|yeah that definitely happened
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01651.wav|outlets tried their best to be patient
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01652.wav|very tense week although thankfully it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01654.wav|defending the election
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01655.wav|michigan and georgia
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01656.wav|no more stephen miller at the white
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01658.wav|they remember faces and they hold
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01660.wav|for the foreseeable future and i know
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01662.wav|helped to register
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01663.wav|lost do you realize what that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01664.wav|following a boyden harris bus in texas
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01666.wav|actually sums up pretty nicely how a lot
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01667.wav|turned out to be a resounding yes good
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01668.wav|when she said that donald trump is here
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01669.wav|a.m on wednesday
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01670.wav|is now going to be vice president the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01671.wav|not and obviously we're going to start
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01672.wav|first woman vice president
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01673.wav|about what this week means for the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01674.wav|would obviously be when he made them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01675.wav|two key things that we know though the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01676.wav|after the count in michigan
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01677.wav|stacy abrams along with many others
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01678.wav|a bad enough case of denial this is how
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01679.wav|which is just a nice sentence to hear
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01680.wav|trump and his family are gonna stop
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01681.wav|with trump supporters swarming and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01682.wav|up take arizona they announced at a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01683.wav|campaign trail that the ugliness trump
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01684.wav|when will penguins learn how to fly or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01686.wav|question of whether or not they'll have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01687.wav|draw any big conclusions there are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01689.wav|so much to deal with there there is the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01692.wav|four years have put us in but that is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01693.wav|which is both completely unsurprising
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01694.wav|yeah come on now and look i'm no legal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01696.wav|out nearly a million
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01697.wav|and just a final quick point here
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01699.wav|them out to the polls
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01700.wav|she was already tweeting out details
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01701.wav|hundreds of thousands of new voters over
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01702.wav|those instructions is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01703.wav|of this week we all knew that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01705.wav|when will he be able to tell me what his
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01706.wav|that's exactly what the ballot counters
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01707.wav|a big factor in the vote in arizona was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01708.wav|as we are taping this on saturday people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01709.wav|because the last four years were not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01710.wav|real takeaway of this election might be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01711.wav|sounds dramatic but it's also a little
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01712.wav|man alone at that point it would have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01713.wav|donald trump from the back of a moving
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01715.wav|voter fraud meaning if you say wanted to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01716.wav|president the first
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01718.wav|but that took no time at all so tell you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01719.wav|yeah yeah we do yeah
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01721.wav|favorite activities which is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01722.wav|disputed or misleading meanwhile
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01723.wav|before we get into
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01724.wav|you could do that you still can actually
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01725.wav|no more jared
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01728.wav|things happened
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01729.wav|that is a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01730.wav|the trump camp was trying to drum them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01732.wav|throughout their body
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01733.wav|for him anyway which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01735.wav|because she knows what she's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01737.wav|is really a shame because normally the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01739.wav|evidence meanwhile in michigan the trump
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01740.wav|got no clue
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01741.wav|celebrating this election ready
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01742.wav|complaint that he is making a lot right
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01743.wav|evidence and perhaps the best response
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01744.wav|internet comment
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01747.wav|actively supported his bigotry or at the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01748.wav|organizing that vote particularly black
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01749.wav|richie torres and monday jones
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01751.wav|just as there's going to be time to talk
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01752.wav|also there was an experiment a few years
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01753.wav|it was basically the equivalent of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01754.wav|what instead
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01755.wav|counting in pennsylvania
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01756.wav|welcome to the show are still taking
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01757.wav|i bet you did those cookies have gone
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01758.wav|the president of the united states and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01759.wav|banging a frying pan it is really up to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01760.wav|in an increasingly aggressive manner
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01761.wav|anyone about it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01763.wav|body look like is he tall or short does
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01765.wav|tweeted it and that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01766.wav|on someone tossing me in the car and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01767.wav|admitted that he's right they admitted
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01769.wav|while they're away although the poll
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01770.wav|it was like that all day here in new
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01774.wav|immediately before having this picture
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01775.wav|quick side note about those
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01776.wav|cory bush a black lives matter activist
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01777.wav|starts to make sense when you see just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01780.wav|stamina charisma and drive
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01781.wav|so if you say that happen to have any
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01782.wav|fake ballots out of his kia festival but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01783.wav|entirely predictable
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01784.wav|lieutenant governor
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01785.wav|from the white house
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01787.wav|i have no time for losers but here is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01788.wav|looked like this with a whole run of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01789.wav|the trump camps protests were
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01790.wav|anything negative at all let me just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01791.wav|watching the security footage of the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01793.wav|well argue that in the history of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01795.wav|is no easy answer to the question of who
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01798.wav|wild accusations with absolutely no
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01799.wav|octopus but you know what i kind
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01800.wav|but conspiracy theorizing ran so rampant
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01801.wav|you really don't need to cheer him on in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01802.wav|of people feel right now and i've got to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01803.wav|finding nemo wasn't called counting nemo
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01804.wav|my friends and family all saying
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01805.wav|he actually tweeted on saturday bad
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01806.wav|end of this week it does feel worth
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01809.wav|which is probably why the campaign has
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01811.wav|indigenous and latino people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01812.wav|chanting at his teenage son's bedroom
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01814.wav|showed up at a detroit ballot counting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01816.wav|because republican poll watchers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01817.wav|a senate majority
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01818.wav|how desperately
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01819.wav|and party like octopuses on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01821.wav|cloud over the whole process but it is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01823.wav|he looked like he was behind which meant
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01824.wav|moments like this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01825.wav|reason as soon as tuesday came around
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01826.wav|three percent less stupid than that the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01827.wav|voting to protect themselves and their
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01828.wav|from white people about how black and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01829.wav|understand how those images rhyme with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01830.wav|already feel myself starting to do it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01831.wav|all our emails asking you to join us in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01832.wav|other octopuses but if you don't do that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01833.wav|all that which we've grown
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01834.wav|about voting irregularities which on his
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01835.wav|fact all you're doing is making it way
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01836.wav|favorite things which i'm
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01837.wav|these jurists are throwing some shade
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01840.wav|harder for him to finish
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01842.wav|give us all a quick moment
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01843.wav|rooftops in new jersey it was a really
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01844.wav|in the state
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01845.wav|it might be so important to remember the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01846.wav|that suit relied on one poll watcher
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01847.wav|trump isn't going to be president
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01849.wav|watcher could not say for sure because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01850.wav|to james woods which is very much
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01851.wav|being counted after and this is key the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01854.wav|that moment in detroit that we saw
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01855.wav|mainly that a certain someone was about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01856.wav|it's frankly your patriotic duty to send
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01857.wav|and was then completely stuck when it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01860.wav|was lobotomized and given rabies
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01861.wav|messaging primarily because early on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01862.wav|there's a sexual predator pretending to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01863.wav|that has been flying around parts of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01864.wav|saturday morning
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01866.wav|the same time you are wondering
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01867.wav|now so you will probably be hearing it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01868.wav|what does the rest of the pringle guy's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01871.wav|emailing supporters
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01872.wav|spokesperson told the press this week
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01873.wav|but perhaps the single most pathetic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01875.wav|the president's personal lawyer and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01876.wav|case was dismissed by a judge because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01877.wav|and look by temperament i'm inclined to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01878.wav|than it appears which of all networks
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01879.wav|gathered concerns by thousands of people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01880.wav|sassiest week
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01881.wav|it's the highest court in the land not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01882.wav|and the fact is that all of that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01886.wav|just another week look at them they've
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01887.wav|campaign also set up
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01888.wav|isn't great it's like if your grandma
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01889.wav|go octopuses are great they have three
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01890.wav|with no caveats of celebration in fact
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01891.wav|is actually just a zoomed in picture of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01893.wav|brown voters saved
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01894.wav|even that one man is by no means going
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01895.wav|completely opposite instructions it is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01896.wav|for four straight days and while news
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01898.wav|because for some reason this is the life
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01903.wav|that that guy was expecting to get
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01904.wav|actually even more meritless
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01905.wav|then there was that man's shirt
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01907.wav|must have traded in their gavels for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01908.wav|let's look at this raccoon-shaped cookie
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01909.wav|people were actually dancing on the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01910.wav|work gumshoes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01912.wav|and in the days and the weeks ahead
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01913.wav|wage and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01914.wav|i've chosen
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01916.wav|itself had debunked a day before he
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01917.wav|nevada voting registrar
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01918.wav|and making sure that people request
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01919.wav|meat beat that meat he is he's doing it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01920.wav|giuliani was tweeting out this article
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01922.wav|child the answer
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01923.wav|us which just kind of missed the point a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01924.wav|tweets flagged as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01925.wav|is that the election is illegitimate
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01926.wav|worth taking a minute
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01927.wav|in fact just before the presidential
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01928.wav|look it is going to be a long road
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01929.wav|and counting and finding are just not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01930.wav|supply them with an incident that you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01931.wav|be described as a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01932.wav|which they hadn't also rumors were
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01933.wav|now setting aside the absurdity of two
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01934.wav|arrived in pennsylvania to try and stop
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01935.wav|isn't it great i'm not saying i want a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01936.wav|place in this blank void which fun fact
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01937.wav|no more mike pence or betsy devos or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01938.wav|celebrate not just that biden and harris
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01939.wav|accustomed to seeing work
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01940.wav|no more helicopter shouting time i'm not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01941.wav|doing absolutely everything they could
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01943.wav|all felt worth it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01944.wav|resists going as a biden campaign
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01945.wav|for a start you can't just threaten to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01946.wav|and his depressingly popular racism this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01947.wav|women working relentlessly for years
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01948.wav|america based on race religion gender
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01950.wav|record-breaking turnout and over
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01952.wav|and hamsters and speedos now that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01953.wav|democratic party which didn't get
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01954.wav|hearts blue blood they can taste with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01955.wav|give them money maybe it's the last
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01956.wav|the middle school principal's office
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01960.wav|to seeing them in color
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01962.wav|full of political intrigue
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01963.wav|his obstructions
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01964.wav|and abiding disgust for rudy giuliani
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01965.wav|are clearly going to cost a lot of money
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01966.wav|back where scientists gave octopuses
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01967.wav|are one case in georgia centered on a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01968.wav|that morning most from heavily
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01972.wav|had fought in world war ii and in the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01973.wav|version of a guy playing with a big
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01974.wav|go to the supreme court when things
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01975.wav|with one message reading
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01976.wav|completely smooth
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01977.wav|at the end of a truly draining week and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01978.wav|could just experience
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01979.wav|this process as fraudulent the fact is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01980.wav|total hearsay the trump campaign's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01981.wav|the days of counting the misinformation
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01983.wav|which our observers were not allowed to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01986.wav|want a tank top
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01987.wav|their arms their brains are spread
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01988.wav|wildly divergent definitions we have of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01989.wav|didn't happen the biden crime family
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01990.wav|country's first openly transgender
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01991.wav|campaign requested the absentee ballots
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01992.wav|and you're really happy for it but at
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01994.wav|count the votes because they were
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01995.wav|lieutenant governor stonecold is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01996.wav|about just one man
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01997.wav|that this election had record
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01998.wav|very much who we are in fact you could
../../input/johnoliver/wav/01999.wav|is just how painfully clear it is there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02000.wav|is kind of who we are we're the country
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02001.wav|ecstasy they'll hang out and party with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02002.wav|and thought that a stack of ballots
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02003.wav|and send them whatever evidence you want
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02004.wav|half of them people of color and turn
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02005.wav|solicitations in the fine print
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02007.wav|pester them with questions
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02008.wav|he had left the room that particular
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02009.wav|final notice for what exactly to not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02010.wav|election fraud
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02011.wav|and if the democrats are smart which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02013.wav|would terrify the living out of me
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02016.wav|black person we've sent to the white
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02017.wav|were doing it'd be like a dad
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02020.wav|grudges one time an octopus escaped a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02021.wav|with this impassioned speech how many
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02023.wav|black vice president and the second
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02027.wav|and had proof was waiting until that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02030.wav|just couldn't do it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02031.wav|trump sons are so good at getting to the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02032.wav|some of his supporters
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02033.wav|while someone comes in to interrupt and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02034.wav|lawyer tried to wriggle out of it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02035.wav|the week with the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02036.wav|okay that is just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02037.wav|told me to meet him over there in the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02038.wav|and unfortunately the information vacuum
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02039.wav|stop the count okay right but in arizona
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02040.wav|institutional problems
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02041.wav|supremacist in between them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02042.wav|his supporters
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02045.wav|lawsuits half of any contribution
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02046.wav|the past two years
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02047.wav|florida voted to increase the minimum
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02048.wav|although not in office however hard he
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02049.wav|due to the pandemic this election was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02050.wav|tough charge to make stick because by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02051.wav|trump in that room to which the campaign
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02052.wav|representing donald j
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02053.wav|and enjoying it sexually very much
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02054.wav|important thing after this absolute year
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02055.wav|he kept showing them who we are so we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02057.wav|and there is going to be time to talk
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02059.wav|to subvert this election on wednesday
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02061.wav|out of here now one big trump
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02063.wav|that someone who actually witnessed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02064.wav|carry on drifting and lying like they've
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02066.wav|and should not ignore that millions
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02067.wav|too long and for what it's worth
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02068.wav|was how trump was going to react as the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02069.wav|to dig us out of the place that the last
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02070.wav|actually have a ride home otherwise all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02071.wav|about the january th run off for senate
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02074.wav|that may or may not have arrived late
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02075.wav|or are you talking days what was also
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02076.wav|chose to kick donald trump out of office
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02077.wav|soon-to-be former president and his camp
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02078.wav|featuring what i assume were his three
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02079.wav|featuring a dog who i can only assume
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02080.wav|when is michael keaton going to win an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02082.wav|york there was a mood here that can only
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02084.wav|exactly how we got to this point over
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02086.wav|invited people to submit evidence of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02087.wav|absolutely right because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02088.wav|they are not always
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02093.wav|that it was filing multiple lawsuits
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02096.wav|chance to go to the official
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02098.wav|this country especially
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02099.wav|umbrellas because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02100.wav|came from john fetterman pennsylvania's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02101.wav|there's likely to be a lot of talk
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02102.wav|it's not a great sign for your case when
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02105.wav|hate to see him go love to watch him
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02106.wav|how the she got so far with klaus
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02107.wav|reverse why because it combined
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02108.wav|from being inside one raccoon
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02111.wav|sharpies had been used to fill them out
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02112.wav|the court finds that there is no

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02284.wav|it's probably worth knowing that in a

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02289.wav|found he'd removed black jurors at such

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02292.wav|even worse because prosecutors tend to

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02298.wav|more comprehensively

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02303.wav|wow it's pretty bizarre to see a

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02307.wav|this is before

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02312.wav|desperately trying to keep the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02313.wav|some have suggested using income tax
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02314.wav|ways for lawyers to strike jurors and

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02316.wav|is already biased
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02317.wav|the right to a trial by an impartial
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02318.wav|we got curious about him after watching
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02319.wav|jury of your peers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02320.wav|it was once the center of the american
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02321.wav|when it's so flagrant even brett
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02322.wav|called at jury duty although judging
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02323.wav|had repeatedly and blatantly tried to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02324.wav|even give me free hbo and i'm actively
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02326.wav|has got all the hotties zayn zoe
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02327.wav|those two missing cities accounted for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02328.wav|said you couldn't discriminate against
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02329.wav|states ban people with felony
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02330.wav|job a bit more difficult but the role of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02331.wav|i made up it's an actual section of his
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02332.wav|harford error was made by the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02333.wav|hat industry and if you're from there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02334.wav|absolutely none of them are about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02335.wav|three increase juror pay so that people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02337.wav|first why use the loaded term playing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02339.wav|that you can't strike jurors based on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02340.wav|so a production assistant then had to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02341.wav|been a beloved american pastime
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02343.wav|no one would have any idea and all of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02346.wav|practically difficult to strike jurors
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02347.wav|to that show and i know that because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02348.wav|that's a pretty big difference and as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02349.wav|or indeed new britain the second largest
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02352.wav|owl to suggest otherwise is extremely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02355.wav|too young too old single divorced
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02358.wav|lists for instance to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02360.wav|does he ever go to pay for something
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02361.wav|like presidents of the spokane
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02362.wav|because right now too often our current
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02363.wav|prosecutor struck black jurors it's how
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02364.wav|courts actually contract out their jury
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02367.wav|but to all owls and these decisions have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02368.wav|race of course a black person can be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02369.wav|mentioned so far because of lawsuits
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02370.wav|trial lawyers have two ways
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02371.wav|because if you're going to forget a town
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02373.wav|tv show delights the host with his
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02374.wav|would mean he'd ask the producer hey
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02375.wav|prosecutor
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02376.wav|that clip and it turns out
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02377.wav|juror in one of curtis flowers trials
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02380.wav|black man was tried by an all-white
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02381.wav|entered into the program and the thing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02382.wav|he found casey anthony not guilty that's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02383.wav|to strike a juror and then do it anyway
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02384.wav|or that sean penn's new wife is a year
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02385.wav|and leave in someone who aggressively
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02386.wav|gregasms like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02388.wav|just look at the multiple murder trials
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02391.wav|always walk around with it on the off
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02392.wav|according to a study of federal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02393.wav|in florida found juries formed from all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02399.wav|exclude black jurors
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02400.wav|working at a head shop
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02402.wav|usa today ranked it the second best city
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02403.wav|puffy coat yeah
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02404.wav|percentage points more often
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02405.wav|selection accidentally excluded zip
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02406.wav|describing in vivid detail how to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02408.wav|then there's allen county indiana where
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02409.wav|yeah it turns out juries are sort of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02410.wav|of the hispanic population which is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02413.wav|serving on a jury really is an essential
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02415.wav|implications for juries
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02416.wav|to incarceration
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02417.wav|like a physical card that says
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02418.wav|are just flat out ridiculous like saying
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02419.wav|we reached out to that prosecutor who
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02420.wav|things you least want to find in the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02421.wav|when they're entirely white things tend
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02422.wav|can you make me a race card for my
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02423.wav|there the defendant's peers or the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02424.wav|wide variety of reasons to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02425.wav|look it is ridiculous to assume that a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02426.wav|has great hashtag weekends anymore we're
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02427.wav|duty hey summons for which is one of the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02429.wav|people with headshot experience are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02431.wav|a high rate the odds of it happening by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02432.wav|that ruling was handed down and was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02433.wav|another to add to that depressing list
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02434.wav|his case made it all the way to the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02435.wav|or to use the proper collective noun for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02436.wav|accidentally pull out his race card and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02438.wav|show on greg but sadly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02441.wav|how did he get that card did he make it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02442.wav|how much money you probably spend on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02443.wav|of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02444.wav|over the six trials of jurors
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02445.wav|just listen to this public defender
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02446.wav|that he tried
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02447.wav|okay first any white people who use the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02449.wav|how that might affect your relationship
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02450.wav|their list of names had been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02451.wav|and even putting aside the bigotry there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02452.wav|and a jacket should never be an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02453.wav|when it doesn't but most importantly how
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02454.wav|that doesn't happen anymore our current
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02455.wav|whites jurors who were seated
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02456.wav|now he's actually right you don't get
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02457.wav|is one of those jobs and whether the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02458.wav|blatantly he did it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02459.wav|right of people are excluded there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02460.wav|not a compliment
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02461.wav|to explain lawyers playing the race card
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02462.wav|send a middle piggy then maybe we'll
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02463.wav|through who we let lawyers select we are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02466.wav|through an alphabetical list of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02467.wav|it's an abc supremacist system that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02468.wav|think about it z
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02469.wav|and that's before you even get into the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02470.wav|government's own system but many
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02471.wav|of african americans in that county
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02472.wav|how they were able to do that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02474.wav|run to -eleven and only getting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02475.wav|just how lax the design process had been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02476.wav|and i'd love to tell you mistakes like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02477.wav|and not an adjective are pretty
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02478.wav|black member and that's one of those
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02480.wav|felt pretty clear about why she'd been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02481.wav|guess my broader point is there are two
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02483.wav|consequences
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02484.wav|who's done exactly two good things in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02485.wav|row and is currently out on bail
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02486.wav|county's jury system was originally
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02487.wav|of being included on a jury
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02488.wav|sued over the makeup of his jury and his
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02489.wav|the race card or you know
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02491.wav|and i know we don't have time but i
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02492.wav|let's see i've asked about where you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02494.wav|fridays and read the room greg no one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02495.wav|a single black person
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02496.wav|with law enforcement can be hugely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02497.wav|have and finally and i know this isn't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02498.wav|juror can't be impartial because of some
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02499.wav|of curtis flowers in mississippi
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02500.wav|city in that district because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02501.wav|to go south fast
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02502.wav|both of which disproportionately exclude
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02503.wav|i know exactly three things about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02505.wav|from a jury unless
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02506.wav|was it just for the show or does he
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02507.wav|system has many flaws
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02509.wav|official jury list
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02510.wav|alphabetization fails us i've said this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02511.wav|siblings whether your siblings are older
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02512.wav|challenges to make it more
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02513.wav|their algorithms are a trade secret
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02514.wav|sex now the extent of that indiana era
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02515.wav|seventh trial so taken all together it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02518.wav|district courts
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02519.wav|every gear in the criminal justice
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02520.wav|and being registered to vote and owning

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02528.wav|bumper stickers bumper stickers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02529.wav|it's the one that post malone wore to

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02536.wav|of what everyone asked for i'm just not

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02538.wav|do you like rakes and a prospective

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02546.wav|and look to this day prosecutors use a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02547.wav|is too many even for a first date who's

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02549.wav|louisiana found prosecutors
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02550.wav|names unfortunately it turned out
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02551.wav|one question he asked the black jurors
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02552.wav|the better end of the alphabet because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02554.wav|township towards the end of the alphabet
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02555.wav|so tonight let's take a look at why
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02557.wav|cases where some juries were all white
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02558.wav|is a deeply weird television network but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02559.wav|and look there are plenty of jobs that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02561.wav|if the defendant was an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02562.wav|these are rare but the truth is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02563.wav|to be fair can sometimes be pretty fun
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02564.wav|he's supposed to jump out of a cake at a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02565.wav|selection to companies like these
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02566.wav|and if you want to see the lengths to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02567.wav|problem and until a nine-year-old shows
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02568.wav|no public access to jury data so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02569.wav|system would systematically weed out a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02570.wav|sure that programming a county's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02571.wav|spend minutes printing the words race
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02572.wav|or just careless the result is the same
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02573.wav|on a red card is that how it came to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02574.wav|them and even after the civil rights act
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02576.wav|race it turns out
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02577.wav|we can honestly spend the rest of this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02580.wav|by race and while yes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02581.wav|hashtag time soup but while it might
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02582.wav|townships and stop when it reached
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02584.wav|long did that man walk around with that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02585.wav|was very upset saying
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02587.wav|are very bad
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02588.wav|primary obstacle in that department
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02591.wav|have a great hashtag weekend everyone
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02592.wav|show did he throw it away
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02593.wav|you're gonna want to weed out the smart

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02596.wav|i'm serious try in a sentence look at

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02607.wav|while your peers are supposed to be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02609.wav|on how not to get caught let's say you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02610.wav|for instance in connecticut it emerged
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02611.wav|you just heard him say young black women
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02612.wav|there's a big problem there as this

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02717.wav|suddenly it feels like a spike lee

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02744.wav|he's complaining about there they don't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02745.wav|who promise to run the process cheaper

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02750.wav|we do have to move on because the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02751.wav|what the is that to which you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02752.wav|what the supreme court said
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02753.wav|than they do white defenders but that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02755.wav|important thing about jury duty is you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02756.wav|supposedly random drawings and while
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02757.wav|come up with some reason other than race
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02758.wav|and this is reflected in the real world
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02761.wav|chosen from a fair cross-section of

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02770.wav|african-american populations is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02771.wav|probably said
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02772.wav|they can't exclude jurors purely based
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02776.wav|our main story tonight concerns jury
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02778.wav|or did he put it on his desk just in

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02780.wav|awaiting a potential

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02782.wav|people who hated you in high school then

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02786.wav|is enshrined in the sixth amendment of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02787.wav|holding up there technically a race card

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02790.wav|racist even though he agreed that

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02795.wav|making a mockery of the phrase
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02799.wav|qualified to do for instance

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02806.wav|drawn from a pool of jurors without
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02807.wav|course that's where they can show that a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02810.wav|in anyone's beauty arsenal and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02811.wav|balls freaks who sleep in an indoor
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02812.wav|beard fasting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02813.wav|jinping that he should go ahead with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02814.wav|in and think of it as the patriot
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02816.wav|there can be a real benefit to awareness
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02818.wav|benefiting from uighur labor in their
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02819.wav|on a bus to their new accommodations all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02820.wav|we're gonna talk about eyelashes look
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02822.wav|i'm not even getting into the reports of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02823.wav|still haunted to this day for two years
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02826.wav|address the complex underlying factors
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02827.wav|about pants but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02828.wav|if it looked like this instead why did
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02829.wav|even more on the nose like the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02830.wav|purple pervert who couldn't give a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02831.wav|and thrown in camps
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02832.wav|it's not just nike another company on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02833.wav|there's a tick tock makeup tutorial that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02834.wav|and this one taffa because together they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02835.wav|held bigoted views
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02836.wav|camps at all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02837.wav|to make it clear what these camps really
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02840.wav|and transferring many uyghurs to prisons
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02841.wav|versus them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02842.wav|government has been treating them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02843.wav|that seem to be trying to break the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02847.wav|that conservatively
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02848.wav|completely non-negotiable
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02849.wav|atmosphere of extreme discrimination
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02850.wav|actively using their financial leverage
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02852.wav|a million uyghurs were at one point
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02854.wav|week and instead let's talk about this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02855.wav|holy that might be the single
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02856.wav|surveillance system
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02857.wav|because when you're dealing with a

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02861.wav|freedom for a second
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02866.wav|i can't remember but basically the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02867.wav|spooky little doll hands
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02868.wav|china's also created a system of mass
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02870.wav|forced to attend patriotic education and

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02888.wav|i'd totally a camel and by the way
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02889.wav|up bars but look china doesn't just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02891.wav|and resentments amid an overall
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02892.wav|unless people pay attention and look i
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02893.wav|is particularly appalling so tonight

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02896.wav|criticism by invoking atrocities ranging

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02901.wav|and they're conducting ongoing diligence
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02902.wav|i don't stop stacking plates i call this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02903.wav|against top chinese officials and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02904.wav|back boobs but then you see those eyes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02905.wav|have free choice so in the end they shut
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02906.wav|will commit to the crimes that the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02907.wav|camps has intensified
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02910.wav|oh boy all of a sudden really really not

../../input/johnoliver/wav/02918.wav|you don't put the work in bro
../../input/johnoliver/wav/02919.wav|just talk about doing it and hope people

../../input/johnoliver/wav/03056.wav|despite having committed no crimes which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03058.wav|on steroids because all of a sudden
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03061.wav|and let's start with a bit of context
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03062.wav|why does he have the posture of a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03065.wav|describe all raccoons i mean yeah they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03066.wav|something fun and quickly ruining it so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03067.wav|looking into what china has done in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03068.wav|do is continue to pay attention
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03069.wav|lunch lady because from the hours of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03070.wav|their ceo was challenged about whether
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03072.wav|they found no indications of forced
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03073.wav|religiously extreme views
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03074.wav|which is more than percent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03075.wav|and you remember oh yeah
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03076.wav|okay that is both insane logic and also
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03077.wav|and other ethnic minorities into factory
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03078.wav|choked ethnic minorities so hard that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03080.wav|baby names that are considered to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03082.wav|policy on oversight is less just do it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03083.wav|will know to stand up and say
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03084.wav|can't breathe and look those are fair
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03085.wav|to pressure the chinese government to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03086.wav|out uyghurs are being shipped and not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03087.wav|yeah it's true the very masks that some
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03088.wav|other ethnic minorities
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03090.wav|possible way covering it with a cartoon
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03091.wav|may never know the answers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03092.wav|initially denied the existence of the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03093.wav|report put it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03094.wav|a scientology picnic hey we're just here
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03096.wav|got electric shocks for taking too long
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03097.wav|culture off the map and you know what
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03098.wav|detected by the city's eye-based
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03100.wav|about economic opportunity
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03102.wav|those are fair points right there but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03103.wav|some of the products they've been making
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03104.wav|and it's strategically important but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03105.wav|for weaker children now other moves by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03106.wav|will allow for distancing them from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03108.wav|last one clearly would not be an issue
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03110.wav|living dormitories under constant
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03111.wav|in fact xinjiang is now one of the most
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03112.wav|even the heavily orchestrated media
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03113.wav|uyghur poet was buried into something
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03115.wav|without obvious reasons although that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03117.wav|they've been doing it since world war ii
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03119.wav|deep in the supply chain of global
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03120.wav|training centers anymore
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03121.wav|to power and instituted what was called
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03122.wav|now nike has claimed that this factory
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03123.wav|visited the factory of one of nike
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03124.wav|then was transferred into forced labor
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03125.wav|person's sunglasses and look
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03126.wav|the very basis of the pre-crime system
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03127.wav|and now you can enjoy house of cards
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03129.wav|right here it's not called a workout if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03131.wav|to prevent escapes and the phrase
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03132.wav|in recent years the government seems to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03133.wav|it may be getting harder to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03136.wav|because he thought it was exactly the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03138.wav|the exact plot of minority report which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03139.wav|government has been quick to use
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03141.wav|one week it flagged the names of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03142.wav|supply chain some of them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03144.wav|weinstein doesn't go to award shows and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03149.wav|house of cards would be much less
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03150.wav|department where murders are stopped
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03151.wav|behind those riots and other incidents
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03154.wav|with the authorities in beijing they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03156.wav|unacceptable infringement on their
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03159.wav|building the camps
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03160.wav|facilities were told to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03161.wav|boarding schools
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03162.wav|is kind of a lot like finding out your
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03163.wav|the outside world
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03164.wav|that this is the most important thing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03165.wav|i didn't think people had to publicly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03168.wav|were then sent to re-education camps and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03169.wav|that aren't even pretending to be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03170.wav|heavily policed areas
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03171.wav|the genocide of native americans to a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03172.wav|what's been happening to them and why
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03173.wav|really shouldn't be too shocking after
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03175.wav|weaker workers arriving at a train
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03176.wav|and while there is clearly nothing new
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03178.wav|them as religious terrorism beginning
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03181.wav|doesn't even know in just hours but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03182.wav|at the very least so that if an entire
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03183.wav|subject for the chinese government which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03184.wav|time and i know
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03185.wav|before shifting to arguing that they are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03187.wav|connection to this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03188.wav|program the idea as one local government
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03190.wav|quo remains now one day the pre-cults
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03191.wav|let's hold the eyelash story for another
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03193.wav|and service jobs sometimes hundreds
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03194.wav|show went to dubai and state tv
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03195.wav|from laws preventing kids from going to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03196.wav|to keep this story from getting out but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03197.wav|about the weakest in fact just listen to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03198.wav|often being favored over uighurs for top
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03199.wav|this is game recognizing game here but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03202.wav|now thankfully as criticism of china's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03203.wav|we have to make sure that the treatment
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03206.wav|hold up hold on that took quite a turn
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03207.wav|governments around the world should be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03210.wav|buy or store equipment such as dumbbells
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03211.wav|out that max von siddow oh yeah by the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03212.wav|in the world with the authority
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03214.wav|escapes is something of a tell there if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03215.wav|wow finding out that volkswagen is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03216.wav|politely asked to leave a costco
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03217.wav|way he's in this too
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03218.wav|a decade-long crackdown that escalated
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03220.wav|seconds and that's genuinely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03221.wav|china's treatment of the uyghurs gave
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03222.wav|that camels are so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03225.wav|mostly uyghurs but also kazakhs and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03226.wav|this information it feeds it into a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03227.wav|vocational training these camps sure
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03228.wav|lashes to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03229.wav|that when she was reflected in another
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03230.wav|we can walk around but we can't go back
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03231.wav|no longer employs weaker workers and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03232.wav|should not only
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03233.wav|the entire global community needs to do
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03234.wav|what the post found feels like their
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03236.wav|i've got two pretty obvious reasons for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03237.wav|any of this is strictly necessary
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03239.wav|their worst infringement to be getting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03240.wav|a culture and faith across generations
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03241.wav|because as you've probably guessed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03242.wav|lobotomy but it turns out i'm both happy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03243.wav|start of this piece are getting made
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03244.wav|see that's just objectively much better
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03245.wav|and chinese state media presents this as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03246.wav|and covering her hijab by obscuring her
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03247.wav|chain by which families hand down
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03248.wav|there she went from promising longer
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03249.wav|setting aside the issue of religious
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03250.wav|people who store large amounts of food
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03251.wav|being held extra judicially
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03252.wav|investigated forced labour estimated
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03254.wav|i'm just saying watching old episodes of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03255.wav|resource rich
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03257.wav|grandparents are still having sex
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03258.wav|anderson's doing well and so the status
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03259.wav|earned a deep dive on how to best make
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03260.wav|the government actually turned an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03261.wav|your eyelashes pop and to that end
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03263.wav|with our suppliers in china which given
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03264.wav|yeah you can't celebrate a stable
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03265.wav|this isn't just a benevolent jobs
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03266.wav|in the bathroom she was in two different
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03267.wav|after china's president xi jinping came
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03268.wav|before they happen now ethically there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03270.wav|to work in factories across china and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03271.wav|barney a dinosaur who is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03272.wav|it's the summer there's a pandemic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03274.wav|discussing concentration camps in just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03275.wav|and frankly i have never had more
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03276.wav|or applying for a passport and this is a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03277.wav|years
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03278.wav|big international brands like nike when
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03280.wav|the list is volkswagen which told us
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03281.wav|and if this is the first time that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03282.wav|one australian think tank that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03283.wav|to work in factories across
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03284.wav|complicated particularly right now and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03285.wav|encouraging han people to migrate to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03286.wav|it's also completely possible
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03287.wav|small steps here like imposing sanctions

../../input/johnoliver/wav/03292.wav|our main story tonight concerns
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03294.wav|doing so quite suddenly and those who

../../input/johnoliver/wav/03296.wav|that is heartbreaking and completely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03297.wav|prison-like leaked classified documents

../../input/johnoliver/wav/03299.wav|at a glove factory all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03300.wav|others might want to turn away from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03302.wav|years and while they were eventually
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03304.wav|he supposedly was going to disproving
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03306.wav|swimming pool and they scream whenever
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03307.wav|is exactly the wrong thing to do
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03308.wav|play some tunes and if anyone asks where
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03309.wav|congress even passed the uyghur human
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03310.wav|eventually stop asking and look
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03311.wav|secular so much so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03312.wav|extremism with some as vague as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03313.wav|people in xinjiang have been arrested
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03314.wav|from the rest of china's population
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03315.wav|sure it's completely horrifying but it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03316.wav|the chinese government simply painted
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03317.wav|and that they should strictly manage and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03318.wav|over just a two-year period more than
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03319.wav|or thousands of miles from home that is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03322.wav|mostly han chinese but rather than
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03324.wav|entire ethnic group
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03325.wav|generate a prediction
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03326.wav|with a cactus in a santa hat even doing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03327.wav|are absolutely horrific
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03328.wav|let's talk about them who they are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03329.wav|be closing some of them unfortunately
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03330.wav|happiness park complete with fake pandas
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03332.wav|there's an ethnic group in china being
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03333.wav|awareness is actually a necessary
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03334.wav|end these abuses but none of that is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03335.wav|mandarin classes and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03336.wav|chinese government's talk of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03337.wav|but that's not all that they are and all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03338.wav|concerted campaign centered on cultural
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03339.wav|stereotypes but human rights should be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03340.wav|forced labor any more than you give me
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03341.wav|though it is worth noting that last year
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03343.wav|earlier this year but although trump
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03344.wav|xinjiang with them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03345.wav|china called xinjiang and the chinese
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03346.wav|statement that read george floyd's death
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03347.wav|always willingly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03348.wav|a bit so there was that baseline
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03349.wav|and proving that people do
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03350.wav|finds out he's being framed then finds
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03353.wav|and whenever pressed on this the chinese
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03357.wav|they're all siblings or aliens or babies
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03358.wav|your employee handbook says
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03359.wav|automatically makes whatever you just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03361.wav|muslim in a country that is aggressively
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03363.wav|islamic to the creation of state-run
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03364.wav|they're a mostly muslim ethnic minority
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03365.wav|it's barely an acceptable way to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03366.wav|the u.s china relationship is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03368.wav|like they were all potential terrorists
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03369.wav|look i'm not saying
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03370.wav|raging and frankly i think we've all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03371.wav|centered all depictions of a woman in a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03372.wav|since the holocaust
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03374.wav|startled gopher why does he have an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03375.wav|a human rights perspective
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03376.wav|right thing to do
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03378.wav|just as much as you used to which was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03379.wav|and educating them and a lot of people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03380.wav|to xinjiang on our own
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03382.wav|are essentially just kleptomaniac
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03383.wav|the holocaust
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03384.wav|directly or indirectly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03385.wav|do not let them escape and look if that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03386.wav|and attempting to assimilate a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03387.wav|out of a tv show
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03389.wav|it descends into reductive xenophobic us
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03390.wav|clearly aware of clothing he's wearing a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03394.wav|that a few years ago a chinese reality
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03395.wav|you're hearing about an estimated

../../input/johnoliver/wav/03643.wav|fun fact i'm throwing in there

../../input/johnoliver/wav/03655.wav|report those injuries if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03656.wav|and it's not just bathroom break issues
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03657.wav|a comfy drawer most of the day and then
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03658.wav|a full-size motorcycle just like you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03659.wav|they need someone to expel the literal

../../input/johnoliver/wav/03672.wav|are horrific but they do get talked
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03673.wav|but it is not just that that man
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03674.wav|the company's total fine was just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03675.wav|offer first aid treatments on site
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03676.wav|meatpacking workers have contracted

../../input/johnoliver/wav/03686.wav|texas overhauled its workers comp system
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03687.wav|worked from home because it wasn't safe
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03688.wav|because while companies
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03689.wav|it can genuinely be cheaper for

../../input/johnoliver/wav/03693.wav|well that is on her she's a difficult
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03694.wav|and return to your breath namaste
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03695.wav|blender i'd love to be treated like an

../../input/johnoliver/wav/03703.wav|do get to visit the plants the limits to

../../input/johnoliver/wav/03707.wav|distribution centers and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03708.wav|state which have made it harder for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03709.wav|in the meat and poultry industry
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03710.wav|at current staffing levels it would take
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03711.wav|disgusting i gagged in front of my child
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03714.wav|the usda should do more to ensure lines

../../input/johnoliver/wav/03719.wav|little hard to take tyson's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03720.wav|medical coverage
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03722.wav|weren't sent to doctors with one worker
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03723.wav|look there are lots of good reasons to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03725.wav|five whole birds and look there's plenty
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03726.wav|plant after that incident but it does
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03727.wav|the federal response was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03730.wav|very bad and it does imply that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03733.wav|atrocities this absolute nightmare of a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03734.wav|workers hurt on the job
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03735.wav|now legally i have to tell you jbs
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03736.wav|opportunities and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03738.wav|to receive payments in fact in texas it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03739.wav|they are required to report serious
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03740.wav|yeah of course he wasn't because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03741.wav|fine for a serious safety violation a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03743.wav|a family like they love to claim it does
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03744.wav|for hiring roughly immigrants
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03746.wav|are those thoughts going to creep into
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03747.wav|given that the outbreak got so bad there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03748.wav|series of long conveyor belts with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03749.wav|or a tiger or if we're being totally
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03750.wav|to explain line speeds to you a plant
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03751.wav|and when it comes to workers comp we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03752.wav|sleep on the streets people have to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03753.wav|meditation is great for clearing your
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03754.wav|injuries to the government's worker
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03755.wav|only need to take a peek inside the way
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03756.wav|release waive and forever give
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03758.wav|corporate office culture that will one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03759.wav|are black asian or latino it's just a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03760.wav|when the pandemic hit
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03761.wav|depicting him reading a bible
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03762.wav|now clearly the contrast between tyson's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03763.wav|changes in workers comp in state after
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03764.wav|endless trips to the nursing station
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03765.wav|th at least
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03767.wav|own rules for how much workers get for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03768.wav|would want the government to step in and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03769.wav|workers rr family talk given this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03770.wav|your show actually covered in this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03771.wav|has been very bad
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03773.wav|they are even fighting the claims for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03774.wav|is incredibly weak in the average
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03776.wav|companies corporate workers immediately
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03777.wav|perform an exorcism gym or get the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03779.wav|martin a horrific story which by the way
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03780.wav|it's one of the many reasons i have no
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03781.wav|for them to be in the office
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03782.wav|you're actually wrong those conditions
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03783.wav|will just continue and all of this has
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03784.wav|who've lobbied hard both to hollow those
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03787.wav|is not an instruction you give when
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03788.wav|workers are their most valuable asset
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03789.wav|back in. one poultry ceo beau
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03791.wav|frankly saying something given that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03793.wav|but the thing is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03794.wav|agency osha but there is a simple way
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03795.wav|machine look that is clearly terrible
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03796.wav|to be done quickly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03797.wav|osha should implement a federal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03798.wav|protect their workers during this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03801.wav|that review is on tyson's actual website
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03803.wav|companies have been able to minimize
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03805.wav|we can begin the tour and even when osha
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03806.wav|winner take all betting pool
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03808.wav|and lost wages the thing is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03810.wav|segment directly before that one so you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03811.wav|exacerbate other problems such as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03812.wav|asset if you're gonna rank everything in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03813.wav|for a very long time so tonight let's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03814.wav|than their workers are by definition
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03815.wav|they've been hit hard as of february
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03816.wav|inspector now if you'll also just please
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03817.wav|have been doing a pretty good job of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03818.wav|to be a grim story about the conditions
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03820.wav|workers themselves dispute those claims
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03822.wav|neighbor's knife
../../input/johnoliver/wav/03823.wav|to draw a pretty simple conclusion that

../../input/johnoliver/wav/03837.wav|as of mid-december more than

../../input/johnoliver/wav/03846.wav|meat packing is a highly consolidated

../../input/johnoliver/wav/04386.wav|all of what's being revealed is good

../../input/johnoliver/wav/04392.wav|was always going to be hard but it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04393.wav|just two weeks from now which is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04394.wav|three just watch what happened when one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04395.wav|yelling at their citizens for

../../input/johnoliver/wav/04408.wav|so for the first time on Friday to force

../../input/johnoliver/wav/04410.wav|these viruses disposing some central
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04411.wav|could have spent preparing the virus is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04412.wav|their face holy that is terrifying
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04413.wav|exactly how bad things are so strict
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04414.wav|local leaders posting videos online
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04415.wav|early this month about shaking hands

../../input/johnoliver/wav/04423.wav|maximum extent that we can the easier it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04425.wav|compel companies to prioritize the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04426.wav|but you get that the corona virus
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04428.wav|Texas lieutenant governor Dan Patrick
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04429.wav|actually taking part and yet incredibly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04430.wav|number one and the president has only

../../input/johnoliver/wav/04433.wav|of a lockdown is just too great to bear
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04434.wav|the more strictly that we all follow
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04435.wav|have been banking him to use that

../../input/johnoliver/wav/04444.wav|alarming extent there are people that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04445.wav|absurd and yet it actually gained
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04446.wav|just how irresponsible that attitude is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04448.wav|it's not like the DPA can magic them out
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04449.wav|government to take charge of allocating
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04450.wav|this when I go back to being irritated
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04451.wav|you how much I was rooting for him to do
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04452.wav|each other for boxes of life-saving
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04453.wav|do that it's up to governor's some of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04454.wav|genuinely heartwarming to experience
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04455.wav|terms citing the eeriness of empty
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04456.wav|for companies to make them that is why
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04457.wav|nationwide lock down of its. billion
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04458.wav|masks hospitals also need equipment like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04461.wav|quarantine you could do a lot worse than
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04462.wav|I'm sure you've been reading the same
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04464.wav|more people dying which to put this in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04465.wav|abruptly shifting gears to claim that he
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04466.wav|woman immediately so we absolutely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04467.wav|Trump must be so confused by fire
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04468.wav|I died but that's better than whatever
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04469.wav|late night hosts to record shows from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04470.wav|should do everything we can to mitigate
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04471.wav|because we wasted so much time that we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04472.wav|critical shortage of even basic personal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04473.wav|hospitals don't have that many
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04474.wav|resembling normalcy and floaty and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04475.wav|India's Prime Minister has imposed a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04476.wav|and yet as recently as Thursday Trump
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04477.wav|so led to States fighting each other for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04478.wav|because they are running short to an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04480.wav|only the start of what is needed for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04481.wav|whole epidemic would sputter to a halt
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04482.wav|under control adding stock market
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04483.wav|trading one bad outcome for another it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04484.wav|to flatten the curve on Tuesday our
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04485.wav|ingenuity from everyone in essential
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04486.wav|dismiss a request for ventilators from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04488.wav|resources and a patchwork quarantine
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04489.wav|now obviously that magic wand is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04490.wav|stage Envy and look I know this isn't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04491.wav|production of essential supplies people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04492.wav|year old husband died from this or the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04494.wav|our political system and our national
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04495.wav|now what is clear is that a crisis of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04496.wav|that because you just used the phrase
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04498.wav|mentioned the work done by a very
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04499.wav|and I wish I could honestly say that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04500.wav|corona virus party and his disgust at
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04503.wav|vulnerabilities in our medical system
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04504.wav|equipment shortages are a problem that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04505.wav|little unusual as I'm sure you've seen
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04507.wav|it this week stimulus bill is probably
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04508.wav|Trump actually could help solve as a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04509.wav|need proof of just how true that is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04510.wav|both for the medical workers who are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04513.wav|everyone else and there is still so much
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04514.wav|expressed by his sign language
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04515.wav|parades again and the least we can do
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04518.wav|have to say this significant drawbacks
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04520.wav|states are competing against each other
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04521.wav|deserve among other things a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04522.wav|campaign and own it use the fact that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04524.wav|and this very real photo of him
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04527.wav|actually want his face scanned this man
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04528.wav|Clear View has quietly offered its
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04530.wav|person's fingerprints facial scans or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04532.wav|really does get the message across and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04533.wav|that these systems can have some
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04534.wav|a heinous crime which made for pretty
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04535.wav|the big companies that have developed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04536.wav|can be the targets the i farm sensor
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04537.wav|yes is the unofficial motto of history
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04539.wav|users like the DEA and the FBI he's also
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04540.wav|services to entities in Saudi Arabia and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04541.wav|investigators have had such confidence
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04542.wav|everything down I'll realize that this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04543.wav|are on the lookout for a young woman
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04544.wav|button under his office desk but all it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04545.wav|the Internet there is a decent chance
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04547.wav|of course he's also a musician I can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04549.wav|good oh yeah this one's completely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04550.wav|frequently meet that is a terrifying
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04551.wav|including Amazon's own recognition
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04552.wav|for the One Ring he was just really into
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04553.wav|like Woody Harrelson but while I have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04554.wav|written permission before collecting a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04555.wav|spots as one MIT researcher found out
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04556.wav|one called Trump hair which would just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04557.wav|terrifying series of words to share a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04559.wav|bruce greenwood as always is great and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04560.wav|dies down and for the record while
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04562.wav|he deserves the Wimbledon trophy and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04564.wav|where you live but one of the biggest
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04565.wav|matches were verifiably correct and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04566.wav|your teenage years were a hormonal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04568.wav|doesn't affect state and federal use or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04569.wav|thank you so much for watching we'll see
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04570.wav|photos from the internet so if Clearview
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04571.wav|unsurprisingly embracing it in a big way
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04572.wav|tante at at what appears to be Burning
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04573.wav|received cease and desist orders from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04574.wav|more like deja ARPU and my personal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04575.wav|drained sure then he'd be the top of my
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04576.wav|recognition the thing that makes sure my
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04577.wav|your brain auto-completed the rest and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04578.wav|automatic skip if this ever comes up on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04579.wav|it was the one technology the company
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04580.wav|is a sentence that no one involved in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04581.wav|limited to City law enforcement it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04582.wav|way to exacerbate the problem and it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04584.wav|day at a time and unsurprisingly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04586.wav|that is inherently a good thing he's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04587.wav|experimenting with facial recognition
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04588.wav|Twitter YouTube and Facebook earlier
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04589.wav|face app to learn your name and contact
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04590.wav|recognition let's start with the fact
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04593.wav|a law requiring companies to obtain
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04594.wav|practically comatose and cheerfully
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04595.wav|complicated just Clearview that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04596.wav|feel is most important to tell them you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04601.wav|also need a comprehensive nationwide
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04602.wav|to matching faces in real time in fact
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04603.wav|one's got drunk at Wimbledon in this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04604.wav|it's worth it and the people who do
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04605.wav|one which seems polite but what what
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04606.wav|happens when one man decided he didn't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04607.wav|yeah it is well though here is some
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04608.wav|we're about to cross a major line for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04609.wav|a loser and which one is a winner are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04610.wav|brain to remember the differences
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04611.wav|because even though it is currently
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04614.wav|between baroque and Rococo architecture
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04616.wav|issue because there are currently
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04617.wav|defund the police really whatever you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04618.wav|very good time to be looking at this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04620.wav|searched by law enforcement so you may
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04621.wav|technology to look for people with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04622.wav|a beer thief and how dare you drag Woody
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04623.wav|imagine what this technology would look
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04624.wav|using these systems in ways they weren't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04625.wav|is gonna keep grabbing our photos at the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04626.wav|if a photo of you has been uploaded to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04628.wav|a photo with me face there's absolutely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04629.wav|than a hundred facial recognition
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04630.wav|although that's actually perfect if you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04631.wav|technology eventually becomes perfect we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04632.wav|Pandora's Box openers and even some of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04633.wav|them know what you think about that so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04634.wav|policy and we need it right now because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04635.wav|the world have been happily rolling it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04636.wav|keep working with the police just as it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04637.wav|list and despite clear his repeated
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04638.wav|is the good version the point is this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04639.wav|characteristics and that is good but we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04640.wav|week thanks to those protests and two
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04641.wav|when testing out numerous algorithms
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04642.wav|that they could prevent all robberies
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04643.wav|who went through a shredder look clearly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04644.wav|facial scan which is important because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04646.wav|view human rights laws with the same
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04647.wav|Google Timothy brew will tell you there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04648.wav|serious concerns the facial-recognition
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04649.wav|from residents of all these states so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04650.wav|the impresses our journalists by running
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04651.wav|watched police put one such system to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04652.wav|spanning all their contacts so I'm not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04654.wav|character was rightly mad about that and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04655.wav|what we really need to do is put limits
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04656.wav|of you from when you're a teenager don't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04657.wav|facial recognition algorithms have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04658.wav|wonder that deja vu receives such
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04659.wav|own users tricking them into sharing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04660.wav|who else he might be willing to work
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04661.wav|overwhelming to be honest just so much
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04662.wav|right to harvest data from social media
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04663.wav|review that was clearly written either
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04665.wav|computer but the growth of facial
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04666.wav|companies or indeed by anyone and we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/04667.wav|remember these photos are often being

../../input/johnoliver/wav/04669.wav|TV presenter demonstrates an app called

../../input/johnoliver/wav/04674.wav|outstanding warrants and arrest them

../../input/johnoliver/wav/05680.wav|understand
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05681.wav|yeah i mean that pretty much sums it up
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05683.wav|is infuriating and it makes no alabama

../../input/johnoliver/wav/05699.wav|history isn't over yet
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05700.wav|your ancestors did
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05701.wav|he even wrote an op-ed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05702.wav|redistribution so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05703.wav|taught in school
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05705.wav|look it is pretty clear that we need to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05708.wav|soil in which a mob
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05710.wav|every excuse for slavery is shitty
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05711.wav|out something amazing at once existed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05712.wav|suggesting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05713.wav|but look sadly history isn't always fun
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05714.wav|and classroom exercises that you may be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05715.wav|monster wouldn't want that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05716.wav|george floyd's murder has forced a hard
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05721.wav|there's a lot to unpack there first
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05724.wav|during that era including
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05725.wav|more like something you'd yell at

../../input/johnoliver/wav/05727.wav|learning the whole truth about thomas
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05728.wav|a subject so fascinating we're sometimes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05729.wav|something to do with the fact that the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05730.wav|earlier this year one historian flagged
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05731.wav|and it can be hard to deal with what
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05732.wav|very right and megan mccain is very

../../input/johnoliver/wav/05745.wav|you so much for watching we're off next
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05747.wav|fierce watch laura ingram take one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05748.wav|the forefront of american history and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05752.wav|meaningless date when an idiot dressed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05753.wav|i think she actually has picked up on a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05754.wav|astonishingly tone deaf for two key
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05757.wav|what's happening right now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05758.wav|you can't reduce a person's freedom from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05762.wav|ever since a georgia textbook from the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05763.wav|yeah he was as usual sonny hostin is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05764.wav|yeah that contempt is fully merited
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05765.wav|to expand voting rights tucker carlson
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05766.wav|and one of them was about wealth
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05767.wav|three-fifths clause through the fugitive
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05770.wav|tone-deaf assignments
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05771.wav|many white americans went

../../input/johnoliver/wav/05774.wav|one of the last things that he did
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05776.wav|like those couldn't believe what they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05778.wav|whether or not they look like summer
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05779.wav|because those kids grow up just listen
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05781.wav|chocolate bars and marshmallows together
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05782.wav|that's not a conversation that all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05783.wav|back in when texas was reviewing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05784.wav|like goth willy wonka
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05785.wav|to be a black kid in that classroom or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05787.wav|we don't fully acknowledge the history
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05788.wav|to imagine you'd always be on the right
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05789.wav|he's a little too comfortable with that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05790.wav|friend's legacy by continuing to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05791.wav|and now in their s doing things like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05792.wav|win over this woman who's probably dead
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05793.wav|while at the same time codifying slavery
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05794.wav|important for all of us
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05796.wav|racism anymore just a smooth
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05798.wav|freedom and the economic justice part of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05799.wav|with reconstruction a dozen or so years
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05800.wav|growth of the suburbs in the th
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05802.wav|history while distorted
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05803.wav|it and the fact the constitution is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05804.wav|more political than the choices we've
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05805.wav|also doing real harm
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05806.wav|will not be easy there'll be bad faith
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05808.wav|through the present that might be why
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05809.wav|willing to do crazy experiments like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05811.wav|running businesses or i don't know
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05812.wav|a euphemism on par with calling hitler a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05813.wav|re-examining its past and unfortunately
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05814.wav|really let him down there think of the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05816.wav|designed to terrify
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05817.wav|jimmy john's punch card
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05818.wav|falsely claims there is nothing to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05820.wav|americans are well equipped to have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05821.wav|complicate the hell out of that arc
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05822.wav|is currently taught in schools what some
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05823.wav|than they were when king gave that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05824.wav|supremacy instead of disappearing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05825.wav|or online forums in which white children
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05828.wav|white people pushed back and pushed back
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05829.wav|taught a lot more thoroughly it begins
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05830.wav|confederates
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05831.wav|yeah it turns out that martin luther
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05833.wav|project which brings slavery into
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05834.wav|year it found seven states
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05835.wav|everywhere and they were how big
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05836.wav|to see the process by which white
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05837.wav|and the truth is with so many people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05839.wav|stories like these
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05840.wav|politicize u.s history it's worth
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05841.wav|question that scholars have asked for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05842.wav|how the history of race in america
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05843.wav|realizing it was wrong to do blackface
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05845.wav|slavery down to what is basically a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05846.wav|because among other things the idea that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05847.wav|the child's pornography charges would
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05850.wav|passing on and when you take all of this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05852.wav|ejaculation
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05854.wav|work really hard to correct poor
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05856.wav|washington that wasn't actually its full
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05857.wav|holy white people are gonna freak
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05858.wav|unjust to the south on the ones that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05859.wav|they wouldn't gain their freedom until
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05860.wav|of americans were either
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05861.wav|that they will no longer be bothered or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05863.wav|had taken it away and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05864.wav|them oh no
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05865.wav|misunderstanding our history either by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05866.wav|you would be shocked if that happened
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05867.wav|national conversation about this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05869.wav|weird mummy ventriloquy it can be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05870.wav|is very much another matter and look
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05872.wav|washington should be left alone and in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05873.wav|with john c calhoun lookalikes who are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05874.wav|it might be a good idea to talk about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05875.wav|your worst day in america really depends
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05876.wav|but juneteenth actually mean something
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05877.wav|still excellent that's our show thank
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05878.wav|two years after the emancipation
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05879.wav|the s and s
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05881.wav|its state standards
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05883.wav|holding elected office and while newer
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05884.wav|also he actually became a slave owner at
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05885.wav|either side of those landmark eras
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05886.wav|someone capable of following anything
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05888.wav|is us and say see
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05889.wav|and king himself understood why it was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05892.wav|when he is gone and if kids aren't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05893.wav|first of all it says a lot about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05894.wav|a conversation the coverage of that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05895.wav|and admitting it to his father by saying
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05898.wav|the history of america is a history of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05900.wav|about what is wrong with that argument
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05901.wav|school and state standards

../../input/johnoliver/wav/05904.wav|of the sky by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05905.wav|strategist who worked for among others
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05906.wav|about that massacre that happened
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05907.wav|century where
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05908.wav|to be published posthumously which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05910.wav|those dots are very much there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05912.wav|playing that lee atwater take two third
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05913.wav|state standards only two
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05914.wav|who understood that john lewis
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05916.wav|and that actually brings us to the final
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05917.wav|were lynched and by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05918.wav|speech and our housing and education
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05922.wav|one of the problems with the way that we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05923.wav|and also other things the constitution
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05924.wav|tom cotton said
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05925.wav|that badly does not want to be changed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05926.wav|misleadingly comforting versions of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05927.wav|all the way up to the present day
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05929.wav|and the frequency with which stories
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05930.wav|la are still
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05931.wav|been political after the civil war the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05936.wav|in schools and beyond the first is that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05937.wav|when the president in the midst of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05938.wav|with the fact that there are no
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05942.wav|informed texas that enslaved people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05943.wav|importance of drawing a line from the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05944.wav|authors who both extolled the ideals of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05946.wav|to shop at cvs but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05948.wav|how the pieces fit together here is one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05949.wav|while i know it's easy to distort king's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05950.wav|a lot out in fact take the march on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05952.wav|actually did a whole minute piece
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05953.wav|good i mean it'd be fine if nearly half
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05954.wav|a pretty remarkable euphemism
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05955.wav|know the same history is written by the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05956.wav|you might think you can grow your
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05957.wav|that is possible to do kids can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05958.wav|with an estimated
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05960.wav|resources meaning that among other
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05964.wav|the most absurd disconnect was in the

../../input/johnoliver/wav/05968.wav|history and while i obviously
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05969.wav|yeah that's all ugly but in a sign of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05970.wav|here it's how you're being made to feel
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05971.wav|built in their neighborhoods and that is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/05974.wav|upgrade the way that we teach our

../../input/johnoliver/wav/06008.wav|over the past half century you don't get

../../input/johnoliver/wav/06013.wav|can be revolutionary and also racist
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06015.wav|is definitely more palatable especially

../../input/johnoliver/wav/06019.wav|unjust to l ron hubbard on leah remini's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06020.wav|and some who learned history from books
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06023.wav|that someone was incredibly racist in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06026.wav|trust me i'm british one of our most
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06027.wav|in many people's knowledge of us history
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06030.wav|but we gave them sandwiches sometimes

../../input/johnoliver/wav/06039.wav|i can think of one john lewis

../../input/johnoliver/wav/06043.wav|no doubt some parents will instinctively
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06045.wav|children's books can be charming

../../input/johnoliver/wav/06050.wav|easier that it is

../../input/johnoliver/wav/06053.wav|was that of american exceptionalism the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06054.wav|schools should lose federal funding if

../../input/johnoliver/wav/06057.wav|the help to just last week when senator

../../input/johnoliver/wav/06073.wav|this to each age group no one is

../../input/johnoliver/wav/06078.wav|mustache into your beard try it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06079.wav|actually learning something the george
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06081.wav|became the target of the only coup

../../input/johnoliver/wav/06144.wav|remotely surprising

../../input/johnoliver/wav/06147.wav|free his slaves in his will it specified
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06148.wav|understand that things can be racist

../../input/johnoliver/wav/06153.wav|history that you don't like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06154.wav|because they were filled with white
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06155.wav|just years old a fact so horrifying
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06156.wav|was presented to queen victoria and that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06158.wav|that they'd already had the effects of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06159.wav|any parent wanting their kids to be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06160.wav|full legacy down to that one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06167.wav|for the past half century which brings
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06168.wav|morgan freeman you must also study and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06169.wav|is for his kids to be misinformed and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06170.wav|to texas to help work the fields and do
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06172.wav|bit weird about that whole violent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06174.wav|filibuster if necessary
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06175.wav|then there was a civil war then there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06177.wav|trump rally didn't just introduce many
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06178.wav|between the end of the civil war
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06179.wav|obsessed with going back to the s
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06180.wav|as a cause of the civil war and we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06182.wav|s claimed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06183.wav|the march on washington for jobs and

../../input/johnoliver/wav/06188.wav|that's not going to serve them well when
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06191.wav|rule under the fair housing act sent a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06192.wav|painful too as america
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06193.wav|if someone only just told you about them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06194.wav|reconstruction were almost immediate
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06195.wav|even in liberal cities like new york and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06196.wav|and the caption says some u.s settlers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06197.wav|teach history is that too often it sort
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06200.wav|he's someone who's very much part of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06202.wav|slave clause the constitution both
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06208.wav|then they had a great frolic and look
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06209.wav|black people generally don't hang around
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06210.wav|try to explain why statues of george
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06212.wav|call it a history book so much as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06214.wav|just look what happened a few weeks back
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06217.wav|famous tourist attractions is a castle
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06218.wav|now laura ingram might not seem like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06219.wav|are still problems
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06222.wav|trails off after the civil rights
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06223.wav|vary widely when cbs looked into it this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06224.wav|may not be quite that egregious there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06226.wav|watchmen there is a lot of americans
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06231.wav|very much on purpose we thought tonight
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06233.wav|because what happened there is usually
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06234.wav|don't have time to go through all of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06235.wav|picnic for his slaves
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06236.wav|campaigned for schools to adopt
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06237.wav|only one person was freed immediately
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06238.wav|americans to that massacre but also
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06239.wav|and just imagine what it would feel like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06240.wav|that issue in the years that followed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06241.wav|the current handwringing about how any
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06244.wav|movies can be romantic and also racist
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06246.wav|best-selling author with a side hustle
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06247.wav|on june th a decision
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06248.wav|if you don't have to imagine remember
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06249.wav|so people who read them and may have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06252.wav|but that is actually a pretty concise
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06253.wav|less like the title of that textbook and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06254.wav|in textbooks was intense because you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06255.wav|look at the black white wage and wealth
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06256.wav|just listen to this extract read by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06257.wav|massacre points out talk very
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06258.wav|registration of black voters that's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06259.wav|unlearn that and i know that addressing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06260.wav|unjust to whale on moby dick or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06261.wav|because there are some embarrassing gaps
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06263.wav|the kkk was founded black people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06264.wav|viewing american history's progress as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06265.wav|and britain took it and for all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06266.wav|mistakes like these
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06267.wav|to downplay the horrors of slavery has
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06268.wav|overwhelming majority of school teachers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06270.wav|right where he lived something horrible
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06271.wav|here is a crazy story that you might not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06272.wav|has recently been reminded because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06273.wav|holy now obviously
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06275.wav|name it was called
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06276.wav|three big mistakes that many historians
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06277.wav|has to be one of the shittiest
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06279.wav|what happens in a classroom largely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06280.wav|shamefully segregated and if you don't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06281.wav|figures students must learn about at
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06284.wav|casual betty crocker
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06285.wav|and slavery was ended but whether it was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06292.wav|and look state standards and textbooks
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06295.wav|as an imperfect document with imperfect
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06297.wav|revolutionary and the foundation of an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06298.wav|when you are there is a reason for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06299.wav|the south had regained local control
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06301.wav|tip for anyone with a penis but we also
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06302.wav|essentially asking for there

../../input/johnoliver/wav/06304.wav|school teacher revisit her fourth grade
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06305.wav|advocate for voting rights you know what
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06308.wav|is not a victimless act and a history of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06310.wav|after washington died out of over a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06311.wav|marked how school children have learned
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06315.wav|wasn't slavery anymore then there was a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06316.wav|the less you know about history the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06317.wav|it's still being written and you know
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06321.wav|american exceptionalism
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06324.wav|were being told
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06325.wav|history was reduced down to there was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06327.wav|was in so much as it was present
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06329.wav|and if this is the first time that you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06331.wav|thing and wilmington wasn't even the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06332.wav|day that commemorates when union troops
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06333.wav|like the cohen or diamond which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06335.wav|and you would still be absolutely flawed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06336.wav|mention white supremacy while list
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06338.wav|and obviously you'd need to calibrate
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06339.wav|their suburban lifestyle dream
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06340.wav|textbooks that would accord
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06341.wav|on who you are and importantly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06342.wav|redlining kept black people from moving
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06344.wav|was longer messier
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06345.wav|they teach a curriculum based on the new
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06348.wav|and how we can fill them and let's start
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06352.wav|improbably long-lived democracy but it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06353.wav|daughters of the confederacy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06354.wav|came true and that is the version that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06355.wav|to listen to the voices of history
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06357.wav|one parent made it very clear that the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06360.wav|for the very first time
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06361.wav|teach history properly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06363.wav|juneteenth which is not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06364.wav|felt when he finally found out
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06365.wav|because while it might seem obvious
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06366.wav|in wilmington north carolina
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06367.wav|this a comedy show
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06370.wav|which by the way is a pretty good sex
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06371.wav|thank you for being honest george as a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06372.wav|crafted by lee atwater and designed to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06373.wav|american history and he knew the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06375.wav|you can't but in response to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06376.wav|realizing that they have just watched
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06377.wav|there must finally be freed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06382.wav|reward here are some human beings to own
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06384.wav|now the reason they're mentioning
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06385.wav|merely adapted and perhaps nobody made
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06386.wav|skewed version of history that they are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06387.wav|get back something
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06388.wav|listen to this woman in levertown
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06389.wav|to the very concept of juneteenth the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06390.wav|financially hurt by having low-income
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06391.wav|civil rights movement then there wasn't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06393.wav|made it harder for individuals to escape
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06395.wav|to this guy from tulsa explaining how he
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06396.wav|do not directly mention slavery in their
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06397.wav|jesus would have been best friends with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06399.wav|they don't have the framework to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06400.wav|it's like hearing someone say the whole
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06401.wav|explain to him who r kelly was and told
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06402.wav|you're about to hear the n-word a lot
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06404.wav|being a lazy slave was a character flaw
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06407.wav|again and again this year from the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06409.wav|document is a lot of things genuinely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06410.wav|anti-racist curriculum
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06411.wav|where we executed people for centuries
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06412.wav|midpoint of that century of backsliding
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06413.wav|most americans are taught in school but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06414.wav|and the civil rights act which is often
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06416.wav|and ugly backsliding take the century
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06418.wav|but this clip explains it significantly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06419.wav|like those tend to crop up may have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06420.wav|the truth is the civil rights movement
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06422.wav|glossed over but should probably be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06423.wav|it is always weird to hear someone
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06424.wav|with it at the very least the story of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06425.wav|act in the s they were fighting to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06427.wav|only coup on american soil you're not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06428.wav|movement and when you skip
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06429.wav|king had more than one dream
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06430.wav|all you see is those effects and not the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06431.wav|wait what kind of person would honor a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06432.wav|second common mistake that we make
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06433.wav|improve so we have to teach it better
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06434.wav|gaps they are both larger now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06435.wav|infused with and inextricably linked to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06437.wav|chopping down a cherry tree as a child
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06438.wav|and it definitely doesn't mean the kids
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06439.wav|versions of textbooks and some
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06442.wav|that history right now it might be worth
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06443.wav|return of plantation land to former
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06446.wav|explained her objections to a black
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06447.wav|and the thing is joy behar's version of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06448.wav|according to the tower's website

../../input/johnoliver/wav/06450.wav|not be the number one reason that he'd
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06451.wav|it's not a youtuber who's just now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06452.wav|is political although i would argue no
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06454.wav|history when taught poorly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06457.wav|and inevitably upward too often u.s
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06458.wav|point here which is that we don't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06459.wav|to the present day and i know that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06461.wav|is a white supremacist history of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06462.wav|apart from black teenagers simply trying
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06464.wav|the dinosaurs died million years ago
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06465.wav|just denying what happened it's even
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06466.wav|stalks because they'll later
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06467.wav|the present wednesday which is when the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06468.wav|that smoothly in either tarantino movies
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06471.wav|his wife's death so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06472.wav|connect the dots to the present and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06474.wav|of up to armed white men killed at
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06475.wav|basically a campaign promise
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06476.wav|or as the author of a book on that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06480.wav|and also racist broadcasters can be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06481.wav|speaks directly to what we've been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06483.wav|instance marty mcfly was white because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06485.wav|end quote yeah that's it and that is not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06487.wav|and the laura ingrams of the world will
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06489.wav|in pretty much the same way that india
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06491.wav|victims technically you shouldn't even
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06493.wav|into white neighborhoods
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06494.wav|librarians to write
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06495.wav|and continue to learn it because it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06496.wav|that's a good thing only a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06497.wav|a book of lies because we kind of felt a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06498.wav|john lewis this week in which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06499.wav|taught something inspiring what he's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06500.wav|number one movie on netflix during the

../../input/johnoliver/wav/06502.wav|be insulted by the comparison
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06503.wav|at the time just watch this alabama
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06505.wav|impossible to do effectively without
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06507.wav|it'd be like a librarian writing unjust
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06508.wav|that's been baked into this country from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06509.wav|that when martin luther king's dream
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06511.wav|black men serving in elected office
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06512.wav|as opposed to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06515.wav|soaring speech point to the cast of this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06517.wav|throughout the country in fact just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06519.wav|mostly to white individuals through the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06520.wav|he informed all of the people living
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06521.wav|national standards for what topics or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06523.wav|constitutions and permit the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06525.wav|least black residents
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06526.wav|of real promise when very basically
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06528.wav|in more of its aims than many of us were
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06529.wav|america which matters
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06531.wav|holy i had no idea this happened
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06532.wav|troublemaker colon
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06534.wav|more radical and crucially was thwarted
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06537.wav|while many black americans went
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06538.wav|truly horrific or a sad mummy orgasm
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06540.wav|the s but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06541.wav|history is a pattern that we've seen
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06543.wav|incomplete educations in history while
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06544.wav|no and those passages were in the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06549.wav|are white and many
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06550.wav|there was a chance he was gonna
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06551.wav|doing about it and just as a quick
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06552.wav|desperate they will risk punishment to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06553.wav|protect against the corona virus is by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06554.wav|out a few years ago confinement and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06556.wav|not find inherently sympathetic take the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06557.wav|fortunate just because they're confined
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06558.wav|you're wondering how that prisoner was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06559.wav|series of alarming spikes all over the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06560.wav|Cook County Jail
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06562.wav|don't worry mom all prisoners are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06563.wav|actually brings us to our final question
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06565.wav|in jails and prisons Soph maybe rationed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06566.wav|hard to be released a judge has rejected
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06567.wav|disposal right now this is actually
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06568.wav|about the importance of hand washing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06569.wav|also a very low risk to RIA vent you can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06570.wav|should do is release offenders who've
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06571.wav|then did bad things you'll see that on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06573.wav|make pennies for their labor in fact
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06574.wav|don't even breathe air down there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06575.wav|like a great idea in theory but to date
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06576.wav|typical state prison because they've
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06577.wav|national level to his and I cannot
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06578.wav|make a worse experience than the one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06579.wav|chronic health issues like diabetes and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06580.wav|but also in general because there's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06581.wav|those findings there were activists who
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06582.wav|million people being held in them across
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06583.wav|but I'll say it again if it takes the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06584.wav|county spokesman saying the individuals
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06585.wav|the corona virus presumably so he called
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06586.wav|bringing the virus in and out of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06587.wav|if you are fortunate enough to have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06588.wav|worth asking what the are we doing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06589.wav|incredibly brave and that's coming from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06590.wav|documented coronavirus cases in Illinois
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06591.wav|dangerous shortage this is what they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06592.wav|fact one study suggested that as of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06593.wav|ridiculously small as this worries
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06594.wav|branded themselves as genocide AT&T guys
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06595.wav|just watch this prisoner openly using a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06596.wav|because as much as we'd like to pretend
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06598.wav|will lead to consequences to try and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06599.wav|the lower your demand for PPE but of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06600.wav|cost and he was denied and when you hear
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06601.wav|terrible it sounds like an announcement
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06603.wav|so rapidly behind bars
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06604.wav|vehicular manslaughter or sean hannity
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06605.wav|already comfortably bad enough without
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06606.wav|argue on behalf of people that you might
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06607.wav|case of one federal prisoner who pushed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06608.wav|public safety and are only there because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06609.wav|reduced their population by just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06610.wav|maniacs in recent weeks there's been a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06611.wav|virus outbreak in Atlantis look they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06615.wav|typically hold people who've been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06616.wav|non inmate staff personnel working in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06617.wav|produced by some sort of bad news
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06618.wav|basically impossible to keep six feet
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06619.wav|older in prison has increased
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06620.wav|last question is Blake Lively she poops
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06621.wav|saw the danger signs early on like this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06626.wav|everyone and what we can and should be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06627.wav|April and he wrote a letter to a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06628.wav|job interviews and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06629.wav|he wouldn't face additional discipline
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06630.wav|likely to be immunocompromised with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06631.wav|out in a typical week more than,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06632.wav|handing them coronavirus gift bags as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06633.wav|who posed as a boat Oh
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06634.wav|make it any less true does it there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06635.wav|when they use the phone which might be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06636.wav|they couldn't afford to post bail and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06638.wav|coronavirus and nine have died and if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06639.wav|that you're already providing people the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06640.wav|access to soap and multiple prisoners
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06641.wav|Arkansas Department of Health trying to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06643.wav|you're sick and we'll put you in this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06646.wav|bass fishing contests or even Thorman
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06647.wav|us to a lifetime of social stigma futile
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06648.wav|here particularly during this pandemic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06649.wav|Walmart parking lot for several hours
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06650.wav|for reopening local officials proposed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06652.wav|reporter saying that officials told him
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06653.wav|special punishment hole and when you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06654.wav|an i dog you that there are some people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06655.wav|but then continued to charge inmates for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06657.wav|risk for the virus and the elderly are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06659.wav|someone does show symptoms they're often
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06660.wav|have felt they needed to go out of their
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06661.wav|place them under house arrest and at the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06662.wav|need to be getting as many people out of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06663.wav|struggling to think of more than one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06664.wav|to one place the news didn't go insane
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06667.wav|people on TV excitedly citing isolated
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06668.wav|contract the virus and potentially die
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06669.wav|convicted and are serving sentences of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06670.wav|reflected by some in local government in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06671.wav|that that's an extreme response I'd
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06672.wav|would argue they absolutely do if your
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06673.wav|sentences like Confederate statue inks
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06674.wav|vastly disproportionately people of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06677.wav|detained while awaiting trial or held
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06679.wav|little to no familiarity with the prison
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06680.wav|it's neglect and it really matters
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06681.wav|that and I have to tell you the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06682.wav|episode deal with kwibi or tick-tock
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06683.wav|out to be zero boys in that balloon as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06684.wav|a constant churn of people moving in and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06685.wav|guys I don't know how you could possibly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06686.wav|raised hearing that you shouldn't do the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06687.wav|in rural areas where hospitals can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06688.wav|and it can also get out into the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06689.wav|depopulating prisons and jails as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06690.wav|being a bit of a recurring theme lately
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06691.wav|mid-april more than % of all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06692.wav|die thankfully of course there turned
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06693.wav|who's let out due to the corona virus
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06694.wav|facilities isn't the only way that it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06695.wav|prison the fact is we should be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06696.wav|simply not counting the prisoners with a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06699.wav|who drank wine out of a Pringles can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06700.wav|instructed to sleep head to foot and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06701.wav|as we getting hit especially hard
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06702.wav|punish people by giving them diseases
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06703.wav|reduce their populations which sounds
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06704.wav|prisons and jails as possible which is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06706.wav|since that video went viral in early
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06707.wav|with Laura Ingraham or they're coming
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06708.wav|exactly and that's probably not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06709.wav|the quietest that is simply a fact and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06710.wav|identity forger those are all just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06711.wav|outbreaks in prisons and jails can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06712.wav|the elderly those groups are at high
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06713.wav|the fewer staff you'll need on-site and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06714.wav|that and I'm sure that you will see
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06715.wav|taxidermied George Lucas you seem to be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06716.wav|our main story tonight concerns the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06717.wav|facts the corona virus is rampaging
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06718.wav|believe I'm going to say this credit
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06719.wav|inmates to come forward if your policy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06720.wav|could be linked to just one facility the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06721.wav|I know this might put you in the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06722.wav|society and if this horrific year has
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06723.wav|is in such short supply that it's led to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06725.wav|boy because they were stoked it was just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06726.wav|should always be enough soap and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06727.wav|some facilities have even posted signs
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06728.wav|balloon careening through the sky no it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06729.wav|but on balance the risks of carefully
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06731.wav|only goal is to have a lot of people in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06733.wav|Texas has a vibrant crime scene with a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06734.wav|to buy it from the commissary and as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06736.wav|prisoners wearing socks on their hands
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06737.wav|and while the jail strongly disputes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06738.wav|but in this instance despite the fact
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06739.wav|we've covered before on this show
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06740.wav|percent and people inside jails are more
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06741.wav|as a tadpole and despite his reasoning
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06742.wav|alive and look for the record people are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06743.wav|hundred inmates have tested positive for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06744.wav|really a whole separate population which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06746.wav|was treated as an emergency because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06747.wav|easily spread to the larger community in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06748.wav|now also be sentencing people to die
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06749.wav|let's try not to accidentally hug each
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06751.wav|more than a year and whether you're in a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06752.wav|thing yeah it mates feel like it's just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06753.wav|mother of one prisoner explains they're
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06754.wav|complete i don't want him to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06755.wav|especially at that last facility at
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06756.wav|beds and a toilet in fact I'd argue you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06757.wav|through prisons and jails is especially
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06758.wav|yeah martin shkreli the farmer bro tried
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06759.wav|look I am NOT saying that every person
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06760.wav|lot more variety than your frankly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06761.wav|residents had contracted the virus and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06763.wav|despite doing most of the work to keep
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06765.wav|that are scarce PPE
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06766.wav|pay attention to human lives then we are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06767.wav|corona virus you know the thing you have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06770.wav|particularly the immunocompromised and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06773.wav|country but one particular kind of place
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06774.wav|remember when Balloon Boy was the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06775.wav|while driving an electric cart around a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06776.wav|they leave work every day and head back
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06777.wav|with a crisis like this because it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06778.wav|way to try and alert the world to this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06779.wav|of me you wouldn't be too far off if you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06782.wav|man is bit no I absolutely do not want
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06783.wav|be for those people to socially distance
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06785.wav|point here is coronavirus doesn't stay
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06786.wav|sight as for prisons the bare minimum we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06787.wav|practice social distancing when you live
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06788.wav|call outbreaks of a deadly virus
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06789.wav|in a dark place and I know that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06790.wav|those deer knew had a party back
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06791.wav|that County to meet the state standards
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06792.wav|other criminals in Texas like the man
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06793.wav|coronavirus cases we might as well be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06795.wav|by the risks of leaving everyone in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06797.wav|regularly washing your hands
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06798.wav|course when releasing inmates this is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06800.wav|simply ask this what else are they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06802.wav|can't practice most things under those
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06803.wav|frankly something we should be doing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06804.wav|we have no excuse for not releasing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06805.wav|had about how millions of people ended
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06806.wav|that the men in that video were actually
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06807.wav|to get released to home arrest so that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06808.wav|the government's own count at that one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06809.wav|home and took a popsicle or the man who
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06810.wav|prisons have nowhere else to quarantine
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06811.wav|trial in jail who pose little risk to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06812.wav|kind of criminal there burglar thief
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06815.wav|in these facilities the easier it will
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06818.wav|workers have reported over,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06819.wav|them and it's not a great incentive for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06820.wav|group with higher health risks between
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06821.wav|what can we do well realistically we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06822.wav|disease because of my public
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06823.wav|attention-starved
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06824.wav|for minor sentences while prisons
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06825.wav|although you should also know that by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06826.wav|it Rhona juice and then sell it for five
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06827.wav|community when sick prisoners are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06828.wav|tree frog who clearly wasn't held enough
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06829.wav|from it I don't want that for anyone
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06830.wav|problem and that issue is actually
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06831.wav|always be enough soap but that doesn't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06832.wav|they should always be enough soap and I
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06834.wav|is the kind of thing you should only
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06835.wav|California when an outbreak in a Santa
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06836.wav|frankly no reason whatsoever we should
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06837.wav|letting people out are vastly outweighed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06838.wav|which is terrible because we don't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06839.wav|which as of April about % of its
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06840.wav|immediately especially those awaiting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06841.wav|memo instructing federal prisons to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06843.wav|please stay inside you extremely fragile
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06844.wav|the reality show wife swap more
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06845.wav|that you might think good that guy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06846.wav|to pay attention to their situation
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06848.wav|really be saying if there was a corona
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06850.wav|crew so tonight let's talk about a few
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06851.wav|that incarcerated people are a separate
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06852.wav|dollars in prize money for cheating in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06853.wav|hamster charged with four counts of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06855.wav|served the majority of their sentences
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06856.wav|circumstances apart from games like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06857.wav|being sentenced to time you've been sent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06858.wav|shows like crime porn for old White's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06859.wav|things why the corona virus has spread
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06861.wav|basically pausing their sentence and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06862.wav|in what's basically a closet with two
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06863.wav|our current system you're never just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06864.wav|to deal with this problem are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06865.wav|thousand percent more than it should
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06866.wav|hypertension so this is an immensely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06869.wav|completely fine and neither was sick
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06870.wav|contraband cell phone which he knows
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06871.wav|everyone knows by now a key way to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06872.wav|the spread of a potentially deadly virus
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06873.wav|authorities at that prison have said
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06875.wav|percent and that's simply not enough and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06876.wav|truly was a simpler time to be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06877.wav|exists oh you went to a Shoney's did you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06878.wav|correctional institutions which is so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06880.wav|whether or not prisons even work which I
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06881.wav|cases of people who were released and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06882.wav|take all of this together
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06883.wav|craziest story you had to worry about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06884.wav|up incarcerated in the first place and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06885.wav|comforting for a mother to hear is it oh
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06886.wav|color and some prisoners have become so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06887.wav|Barbara prison made it difficult for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06888.wav|if he issued a statement saying the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06889.wav|has been so lacking that inmates can't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06890.wav|having them return to finish it once the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06891.wav|some of the steps authorities have taken
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06892.wav|it was later revealed to be a hoax
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06893.wav|country and another, walk out so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06894.wav|prisons and jails were closed systems
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06897.wav|before we get into jails where there is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06898.wav|they're really a whole separate
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06899.wav|population and the director of the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06900.wav|or not available at all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06901.wav|stuck in truly desperate straits and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06903.wav|prisons across the country and those
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06904.wav|out into the community and staff
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06906.wav|protections and the uncertainty about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06909.wav|that martin shkreli is an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06910.wav|the impact that has on absolutely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06911.wav|anyway but right now we really don't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06913.wav|try and get anyone in the outside world
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06914.wav|prisons and jails running inmates only
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06915.wav|are not out in the community so it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06916.wav|with a human squash court
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06917.wav|easily get overwhelmed and that is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06918.wav|the country and inmates are generally a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06919.wav|and went around shrieking there should
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06920.wav|was forced to return three thousand
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06921.wav|slapped on a suit faked a British accent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06922.wav|alarming given that there are.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06923.wav|of that is immoral enough there is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06924.wav|destruction of property for a system to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06926.wav|dating Ainsley Earhardt one of those is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06927.wav|attorney general part released a DOJ
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06929.wav|a rogue volunteer broke into someone's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06930.wav|literally anything so at this point it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06931.wav|system it can be easy to ignore this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06932.wav|then there's the simple issue of soap as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06933.wav|obviously a much larger discussion to be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06934.wav|is basically look just tell us that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06936.wav|know if you wanted to do a decent parody
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06937.wav|to make the family who had appeared on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06939.wav|me a man who was never missed an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06940.wav|pandemic is under control or you can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06941.wav|can spread it can hop from prison to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06943.wav|prisons because not everyone in a prison
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06944.wav|treated at local hospitals particularly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06946.wav|then I've got to be honest I miss that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06947.wav|be confident about who does and doesn't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06948.wav|he could work on developing a cure for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06949.wav|have much of a choice the fewer people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06952.wav|giving it credit for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06953.wav|facility that is in no way built to cope
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06954.wav|absolutely going out and about from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06955.wav|death cruise ship look cruise ships are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06957.wav|none of us should and yet right now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06958.wav|people are booked into jails across the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06959.wav|to regularly convince your parents still
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06961.wav|have the virus and on top of that if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06962.wav|from a virus because that's not justice
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06963.wav|on this death cruise-ship together
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06964.wav|real and it's the worst one and the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06966.wav|intoxication charge no I have it because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06967.wav|is by no means just cleaning products
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06968.wav|will behave perfectly no one can say
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06970.wav|uncomfortable situation of having to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06971.wav|and if inmates need more they may have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06972.wav|like if our parent company
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06973.wav|breathe in opposite directions we're
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06974.wav|when they're awake we tell them to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06975.wav|percent which is even worse than the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06976.wav|bringing death into the equation it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06977.wav|refresher jails are where people are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06978.wav|low security institution more than six
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06979.wav|they've only done that by around three
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06980.wav|for why he should be released being
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06981.wav|chip two prisoners have at their
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06982.wav|a request he then refused which is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06983.wav|pulled off by the boy's parents in order
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06984.wav|synonyms for stealing what about all the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06986.wav|done they are still members of our
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06987.wav|taught us one thing is that we are all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06988.wav|and generally yeah that guy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06989.wav|millions of Americans are currently
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06990.wav|also place certain prisoners on furlough
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06991.wav|pretty sure we've got this covered
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06992.wav|crime if you can't do the time but in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06993.wav|a matter of time before they get sick
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06994.wav|and the number of people or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06995.wav|much know that as these advocate
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06996.wav|blocks to necessities like housing all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06997.wav|jail or a prison you are probably in a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/06998.wav|marketable to the media and holy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07000.wav|other and who can poop the quietest and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07001.wav|vulnerable population and inmates very
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07002.wav|it's honestly no surprise that tensions
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07003.wav|is in prison there are around
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07004.wav|quickly as we can right now and I know
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07005.wav|apart in a tiny cell as Ted Koppel found
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07006.wav|doing he's reportedly been in solitary
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07007.wav|the close quarters the lack of basic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07009.wav|prison outbreaks that they were having
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07010.wav|one boy he contained in a homemade
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07011.wav|which they are very much not for reasons
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07013.wav|behind bars it travels easily which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07014.wav|take me for instance I don't have Lyme
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07015.wav|the saddest sock puppet ever and testing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07016.wav|prison as inmates are transferred around
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07018.wav|who else was there the whole town Wow
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07019.wav|put an even more optimistic spin on the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07020.wav|man who was warning people back in March
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07021.wav|we're about to get into it's weird to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07022.wav|generator that spits out random
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07023.wav|population than not whatever they've
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07024.wav|placed in solitary confinement because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07027.wav|incidentally the correct answer to that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07028.wav|largest clusters of coronavirus are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07029.wav|how that sounds because we were all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07030.wav|opportunity to say I'm sorry for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07031.wav|institutions yeah it's true the five
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07032.wav|he'd seen him on television." And of course he did.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07034.wav|. And I have to say,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07035.wav|It was founded by a veteran named Brian Kolfage,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07037.wav|three, seriously, who the fuck was Paul?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07038.wav|not a real construction company.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07039.wav|nobody's been able to find those champion climbers,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07040.wav|one, who the fuck was Paul? Two, not enough Paris,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07041.wav|actually turned down Fisher's initial wall designs
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07042.wav|The group also helped fund another Fisher wall
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07043.wav|which it is not, to that tie,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07044.wav|and slicing up people's land. And the thing is,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07046.wav|male enhancement pills, he picks companies
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07047.wav|and orders what he sees on FOX commercials,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07048.wav|of his first campaign. He talked about it constantly.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07049.wav|in border building contracts.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07050.wav|and federal regulatory bodies including criminal charges
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07052.wav|of border fencing and more like the name
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07053.wav|And do you really think now is the time to argue
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07055.wav|Disrupting animals migratory patterns,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07056.wav|border patrol agents had advised him against,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07058.wav|But we thought for tonight, especially ahead
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07060.wav|at least make it Saudi Arabia's actual
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07061.wav|And has spent the last three-and-a-half years
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07063.wav|Yeah. Steve Bannon,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07064.wav|at the Southern border, so that he could tap into
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07065.wav|than any other time in his presidency.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07067.wav|but also by hooking up with We Build The Wall.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07068.wav|Trump knows would be wrong, but who knows.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07069.wav|And look, if you're gonna hold
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07070.wav|But it is true, eight prototypes were built
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07071.wav|That sounds less like a description
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07072.wav|That's our show. Thank you so much for watching.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07073.wav|but definitely paints this moment
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07074.wav|In other words, putting walls
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07075.wav|Like this one that Kolfage excitedly put on Instagram
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07076.wav|or people from entering the country,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07078.wav|Which is just utterly insane.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07079.wav|Instead, we are, and in the dumbest possible way.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07080.wav|It even had a fundraising wall-a-thon featuring
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07081.wav|All of this was even stupider than I thought was possible
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07082.wav|and we're both named John. Sure, yeah,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07083.wav|But even I didn't see some of this coming.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07084.wav|or Roger Ailes' death.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07085.wav|with this, but just a few notes,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07086.wav|Okay. So, it turns out it really is the Lamborghini
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07087.wav|do not buy the Super-Duper Wall,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07088.wav|unless you want to wind up with a pile
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07089.wav|new sections are currently going up
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07090.wav|He looks like his parents started with the name
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07091.wav|to climb mountains." That was,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07092.wav|Tommy Fisher, knows how to curry favor
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07093.wav|of the RNC next week, it'd be a good time
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07094.wav|And if you want to see just how nonsensical...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07095.wav|which would work best, and it didn't go well.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07096.wav|the Real ID Act of giving the administration
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07097.wav|That was Trump, recognizing in real time,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07100.wav|If I knew nothing else about Donald Trump,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07101.wav|But only...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07102.wav|which I do admit are a great idea
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07106.wav|with a checkered past that partnered with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07107.wav|Those are very different. Claiming that they're the same
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07108.wav|And the devastation caused by this wall
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07109.wav|And if, perhaps, nothing more emblematic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07111.wav|That's horrible.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07112.wav|A bunch of the rest of the border
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07113.wav|it's worth remembering, most of that happens
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07114.wav|the first words out of my mouth would be,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07115.wav|a man named Chad Wolf, pushes back on that claim hard.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07116.wav|a shady non-profit whose backers are now under indictment
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07117.wav|three assumptions, bad knees, weird dick,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07120.wav|because it would block their view
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07121.wav|And this is costing a lot of money.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07122.wav|AS that man told Congress...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07123.wav|Just as We Build The Wall construction is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07124.wav|It'll lose value and you could break it."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07126.wav|a few things. What he's built,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07127.wav|we discussed how the wall seemed,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07129.wav|which has enabled them to plow through
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07130.wav|but are pleasantly surprised that it happened so soon.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07131.wav|that's a hard pass from both me and the president.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07132.wav|Claiming that...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07133.wav|Mexico, obviously, is not paying for the wall.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07134.wav|Or the fact that I knew the Babadook was gay
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07135.wav|was completely predictable.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07136.wav|Take what happened just this Thursday.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07137.wav|of cracked fiberglass, and a flattened toddler.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07138.wav|quite a bit of that money wound up getting redirected
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07139.wav|of the construction industry. But wait, there's more.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07140.wav|like a panini. So the design
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07142.wav|is a bit of a challenge. And with presidents,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07143.wav|that led to Steven Bannon's arrest on Thursday.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07144.wav|He's just some guy they used to fundraise,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07145.wav|I'd much rather have said that about fact that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07146.wav|From the pointlessness of a beauty contest in the desert
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07147.wav|and yet, according to this week's indictment,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07149.wav|was justified, which it wasn't.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07150.wav|that claim is bullshit. Not just because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07152.wav|and something that the damages of which we're gonna have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07153.wav|Just like that Tom Brady you like,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07154.wav|on a bunch of small children. Listen to me,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07156.wav|from this Wall-a-thon in a very different light.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07157.wav|that should be in danger of collapsing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07158.wav|Here is the old barrier in a remote section of Arizona.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07159.wav|to be dealing with for a very long time.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07160.wav|but Trump is actually president now.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07161.wav|doesn't want to climb mountains. He's giving me information
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07162.wav|Not in my Stars Hollow, and finally,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07163.wav|where it was easiest to do that.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07164.wav|all of this is only gonna accelerate.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07166.wav|because the fact is this wall is not a functional barrier.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07167.wav|they raised did go to construction.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07169.wav|And the thing is, should Trump be reelected
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07170.wav|Turns out they really are the Tom Brady
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07171.wav|he wanted it to define him as a president.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07172.wav|And if you know anything about this administration,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07173.wav|because Fisher's company had a lot of obvious red flags.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07175.wav|And the story behind that arrest
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07176.wav|that had been set aside for things like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07177.wav|selling personalized bricks.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07178.wav|to praise the president and sell his wall.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07180.wav|that he intended. So let's try and break down
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07183.wav|and I can't stress this enough, assumed.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07186.wav|are causing significant problems.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07187.wav|which says...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07188.wav|how he could be added to Mount Rushmore.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07192.wav|to build a giant wall across the border.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07193.wav|ran an asphalt plant.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07194.wav|so they could test them to figure out
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07195.wav|Specifically, they said they gave
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07197.wav|to permanently close it. But wait, I'm still not done.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07199.wav|I already have. And obviously,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07200.wav|Okay, first, let's deal with the sheer
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07201.wav|Trump's like a shut-in who sits at home all day
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07204.wav|and if I don't, you can fire me like you used to on TV."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07205.wav|because you know what they say?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07207.wav|but instead of ordering Legends XL
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07208.wav|Of course not, get real, be an ally.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07209.wav|to elf funerals. It's the worst thing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07210.wav|One of the more upsetting things to emerge from,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07211.wav|which actually makes more sense.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07212.wav|for what? If this is about stopping drugs
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07213.wav|with Trump. Here he is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07214.wav|one is gigantic and the other looks like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07215.wav|"You must be Chad Wolf." He looks like a model
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07216.wav|Trump reportedly asked South Dakota's governor
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07217.wav|He went on the network ten times
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07218.wav|Trump declared a national emergency
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07220.wav|they ended up going with was a wall of slats,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07221.wav|are actually a little surprising.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07222.wav|But just as with boner pills, you shouldn't just buy something
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07224.wav|Emily says bullshit and tits now?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07225.wav|Crush my rib cage, you load-bearing behemoth.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07226.wav|with an expression like he just fucked his wife.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07227.wav|fifty years younger. And in that show,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07228.wav|banging with a hammer, and that wall does appear
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07229.wav|on Laura Ingraham's show giving him the hard sell.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07230.wav|And I would like to think that that's something
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07231.wav|You might wanna at least Google it first
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07233.wav|saying the administration...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07234.wav|in that shot, which is really saying something,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07235.wav|you'd find at Party City called...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07236.wav|of Trump's border wall. Because, before he took office,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07237.wav|the power to waive all legal requirements necessary
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07238.wav|would be in shambles, the extent to which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07239.wav|is the Super-Duper Wall. I'm serious,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07241.wav|From the idea that Trump's national emergency declaration
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07242.wav|In ordered to have a foreman who's not the actual foreman
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07243.wav|In fact, his administration seems to be stepping up it's efforts.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07244.wav|in a national wildlife refuge.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07245.wav|And that brings us to our final question
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07246.wav|for years, opened my eyes and saw him,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07248.wav|who the absolutely fuck was Paul?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07249.wav|Okay. That's a lot to digest there.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07250.wav|and very-much climbable.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07251.wav|around million of it to Tommy Fisher's company.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07252.wav|that less than a year into his term, this happened.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07253.wav|it will not surprise you to learn
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07254.wav|Joking about stealing people's money is funny
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07255.wav|Because we all know that he is completely obsessed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07256.wav|Like Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar win,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07258.wav|But this border wall? No thank you,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07259.wav|the next question is, where exactly are we building?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07260.wav|for Trump to say, "I don't want
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07261.wav|that he wanted a concrete wall. Something that many
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07262.wav|Because despite what you may think,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07263.wav|with Don Jr. where he described We Build The Wall as...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07264.wav|While that is clearly not gonna happen,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07265.wav|So far Trump has garnered...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07266.wav|Not even Jason Bateman can make those crimes likable.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07268.wav|And you might be thinking, "Wow, that's pretty problematic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07271.wav|So, they cheated to get ahead, got caught,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07272.wav|as a fireman's pole. So to recap what we've learned
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07273.wav|it looks like a candy cane that melted on his shirt.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07274.wav|more eminent domain lawsuits during the pandemic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07275.wav|"I'll wait for you, Daddy.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07276.wav|if the wall can basically function
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07277.wav|as soon as I saw him. Come on, guys.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07278.wav|and child pornography.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07280.wav|And look, Bannon and Kolfage denied those charges,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07281.wav|was arrested. It's one of those things
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07282.wav|where we've been putting them just doesn't make sense.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07283.wav|has told reporters that...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07284.wav|I get it. I get it.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07286.wav|to construct the wall, and that means
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07288.wav|Fisher Sand and Gravel is a company
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07290.wav|for skimming money for their own uses.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07291.wav|...and here's Trump ally Kris Kobach on the group's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07292.wav|for one thing it's impossible to carve stone
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07294.wav|of the Gilmore Girls. And I know I'm a little bit late
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07295.wav|Yeah, Trump essentially organized a wall pageant.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07296.wav|But crucially, these massive new barriers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07297.wav|so he can grunt about personalized bricks,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07298.wav|It's destructive, pointless, ineffective, racist, weak,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07299.wav|With one having the...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07300.wav|This wooden one? Call me tomorrow,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07301.wav|replacing an overcrowded middle school
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07302.wav|along the top of these jagged mountains
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07304.wav|that was invited to take part in that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07305.wav|And when asked to justify those decisions,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07306.wav|into whatever fucking shape his hair is,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07309.wav|And yet, Fisher was incredibly savvy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07310.wav|that you saw a guy named Mike
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07311.wav|is like claiming that John Cena and I
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07312.wav|And they're also using a provision tucked into
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07314.wav|Well, as we pointed out in our first piece,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07315.wav|Over the years, they've also racked up
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07316.wav|Chad-Wolfiness of this man.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07317.wav|Now, Trump was anxious this week to distance himself
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07318.wav|because they didn't meet operational requirements.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07319.wav|anti-climbing plate. And Trump did not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07320.wav|thanks to personal pressure from the president.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07323.wav|that Fisher has now wound up with over two billion dollars
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07324.wav|and it took money from individual donors
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07325.wav|That redirection of funds diverted money
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07326.wav|four years ago, when I was approximately
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07327.wav|added to a small list of pre-approved bidders
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07328.wav|in addition to being transparently racist,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07329.wav|All great jokes have an element of truth in them.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07330.wav|Four, when did both of these women forget
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07332.wav|They're now one of the biggest contractors
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07333.wav|Foreman Mike is not a promo for a new WWE character
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07335.wav|And as ridiculous as that may seem,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07336.wav|her love language is white men begging for attention
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07337.wav|or bollards, topped by a metal,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07340.wav|Even managing to inadvertently point out
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07342.wav|do not buy that wall, it will squish your child
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07344.wav|all the way through a sketchy charity
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07345.wav|is absolutely fascinating, and I promise
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07346.wav|is better for middle school kids that a new school,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07347.wav|and he won't have heard of you. That's just how this guy works."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07349.wav|Isn't that a great list for a company vying to receive government money?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07350.wav|that his signature plan could be completely undone
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07351.wav|And that has very much happened, but in none of the ways
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07353.wav|"This president wanted you to know
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07354.wav|The replacement wall is a completely new
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07355.wav|Given that he had people teargassed,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07357.wav|that's been true, even we didn't see coming.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07358.wav|While I have to tell you, Fisher's attorney
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07359.wav|with a promise that it would build new sections of wall
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07361.wav|And these appearances seem to have had an effect
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07362.wav|It's not even a great list for the Ozark season four
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07365.wav|it's not bound by environmental or cultural heritage protection laws,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07366.wav|Yeah, of course, you don't even need a rope
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07367.wav|In fact, of the...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07370.wav|at one of his rallies that things were going great.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07371.wav|Which is a hard to believe because here is Kolfage
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07373.wav|'cause we all know the best way to deter someone
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07374.wav|And let's start with what exactly he has built.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07375.wav|back to Bannon and Kolfage who, along with others...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07376.wav|Most of it to build that private wall in New Mexico
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07377.wav|I'm sorry... The super-duper wall?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07378.wav|crossing the border is for them to see the message...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07379.wav|this contest is actually one of the biggest
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07380.wav|Fisher Sand and Gravel. The head of the company,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07381.wav|Clinton, Bush, and Obama, hundreds of miles
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07382.wav|because that man is thirsty as fuck.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07383.wav|And that was by no means Fisher's only appearance on FOX.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07384.wav|collapse or get pushed over.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07385.wav|Yet Trump was still so insistent on it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07386.wav|physical infrastructure, I'll show you.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07387.wav|It looks like the tie that Santa Claus wears
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07389.wav|Not just with his constant TV appearances,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07390.wav|a star turn from a man calling himself Foreman Mike.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07391.wav|Attempting to take private land by filing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07392.wav|beauty pageant for camels. A real annual event
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07394.wav|so he could stand outside a church holding a Bible
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07395.wav|writer's room. Guys, guys, that's too much.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07397.wav|how to hold mugs? Five, I'm sorry,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07399.wav|It seems there are issues fucking coming up
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07400.wav|Okay, hold on, 'cause there's no need
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07401.wav|Pentagon accounts for the rest.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07403.wav|about walls so far, fuckable, definitely fuckable,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07404.wav|Senator Lindsey Graham had a pretty amazing rationale.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07407.wav|from Fisher's home state, "Liked fisher because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07409.wav|'cause that shot also includes Lindsey Graham.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07411.wav|we thought we'd look at the border wall.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07413.wav|to objectify camels like that." But the fact is,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07414.wav|he's completely behind this wall scam until it fails.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07415.wav|...and Kolfage allegedly spending funds on...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07417.wav|who's been doing some of the building.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07418.wav|the government has hired for this project.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07419.wav|to feature some personalize bricks.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07420.wav|is familiar at all to you, it might be because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07421.wav|Yeah, maybe a rope.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07422.wav|With Bannon allegedly using money...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07423.wav|Chad Wolf, and then just found a baby to match.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07424.wav|'cause you saw it on TV.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07425.wav|And might be tempted to think, "Oh, well,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07426.wav|Because, from the start, Trump insisted
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07427.wav|I'm just surprised that Kobach didn't continue.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07428.wav|Well, I don't know if you've noticed,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07429.wav|when we played it in our first piece on the wall,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07430.wav|the president's former chief strategist,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07432.wav|Which is ridiculous. We all know the only wall
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07433.wav|on a Kentucky military base, or repairing a daycare...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07435.wav|scholarship opportunities that they have.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07436.wav|two thousand violation notices from city, county, state,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07437.wav|I know that because we literally predicted it.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07438.wav|of how this wall looks, the important thing is,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07439.wav|So that is what the wall looks like.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07440.wav|I didn't think Laura Ingram was capable of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07441.wav|like it was going to be both expensive and pointless.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07442.wav|help build a wall that looks like it may either
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07443.wav|Still, Trump insists that regardless
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07445.wav|Moving on. For our main story tonight,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07446.wav|because experts have said...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07447.wav|Specifically, where barriers were already in place.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07450.wav|If I lost all my memories and fell into a coma
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07454.wav|on paper there are some similarities,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07455.wav|key flaws in the idea, like this.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07456.wav|But clearly, the wall is by no means "super-duper."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07457.wav|putting his plan into action. In fact,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07458.wav|In fact, he isn't even the foreman on the project.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07459.wav|of border barrier had already been constructed.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07460.wav|That is the non-profit organization
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07461.wav|according to one of the senators
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07462.wav|the owner yells, "Hey, please don't touch that!
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07464.wav|or is on private property. So, what Trump did
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07466.wav|America's Next Top Wall in the Desert competition,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07468.wav|Or that a Crockpot would be the killer on This Is Us.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07470.wav|he's not actually wrong there.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07472.wav|on contracts after considering, among other things...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07473.wav|then he hasn't really done very much, has he?"
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07475.wav|built directly along the Rio Grande
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07476.wav|And sexual harassment, tax fraud, federal violations,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07477.wav|Wow. Everything about that is bad.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07478.wav|based solely on his appearance, I'd immediately make
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07479.wav|Who is building this? Because the answers to that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07480.wav|of hot walls, that one wouldn't even crack
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07481.wav|that level of delight, but it turns out
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07482.wav|with We Build The Wall. Saying...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07483.wav|If it's anything, it is a fucking monument to Trump,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07484.wav|through our ports of entry. And even the Department
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07485.wav|And while we predicted the whole thing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07486.wav|and yet they're still around.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07487.wav|of what was going on behind it.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07488.wav|Fisher's company was, nevertheless,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07489.wav|I think we all know how I feel about that.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07490.wav|tied of course, with the reboot
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07493.wav|the top. This stone wall? Scorching hot.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07494.wav|of walls in that as soon as you get near it,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07495.wav|was start building in the places
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07496.wav|but when you compare the two side-by-side,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07497.wav|I knew Pete and Ariana weren't gonna make it.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07498.wav|just before the pandemic, he was reassuring attendees
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07499.wav|I don't mean to wall shame, but if I had a list
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07500.wav|Although it seems to be conking out around years
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07501.wav|Yeah. Of course he was.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07502.wav|I told you so on.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07503.wav|which Fisher referred to as the Lamborghini of walls.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07504.wav|Collapse on my chest, you impenetrable barrier.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07505.wav|To the idea that his vanity project
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07506.wav|...only five miles are in locations
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07507.wav|to give you an update on the status
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07508.wav|because they're technically barriers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07509.wav|That aside, you no doubt remember
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07511.wav|by thick string. And if that clip
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07514.wav|Not exerting myself.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07515.wav|for violations in Phoenix, where the company
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07516.wav|that Trump's border wall was the key promise
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07517.wav|is already covered by natural barriers,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07518.wav|finding places where you can build the wall
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07520.wav|Local government officials have rejected their bids
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07521.wav|because what both DHS and the Umicore of engineers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07522.wav|whose signature move is the chaotic sales pitch.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07525.wav|We Build The Wall raised million dollars,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07526.wav|of Homeland Security's own inspector general,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07528.wav|where the hottest camels are evaluated...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07529.wav|of his presidency than this wall.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07530.wav|that we'll get into it later in this piece.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07531.wav|But he is actually right there.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07532.wav|And believe me, this is the last thing I wanted to say
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07533.wav|are the same because we're the exact same age
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07534.wav|...which is just fucking disgusting.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07535.wav|And look, to be fair, some of that million dollars
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07536.wav|for a knock-off Top Gun costume
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07537.wav|a weird contest in the middle of the desert,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07539.wav|Charges only reduced to civil penalties after Fisher agreed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07541.wav|Native American communities with devastating effects.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07542.wav|he also doesn't need it. Because this is his monument.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07543.wav|what damage it's done, and crucially,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07545.wav|And here is the new structure.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07546.wav|issues a scathing report just last month
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07547.wav|own YouTube page being pretty unequivocal about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07550.wav|but also, because of this.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07551.wav|that you knew would eventually happen,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07553.wav|of an off-brand playset recalled because it collapsed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07556.wav|that we need fewer camels in STEM?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07557.wav|A government report found...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07558.wav|But, Trump's acting secretary of homeland security,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07559.wav|you big tease. This human wall?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07561.wav|Just look at one of the companies
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07563.wav|like that design, reportedly telling officials,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07564.wav|where no barriers at all previously existed.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07565.wav|he might collapse if you press on it too hard.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07566.wav|Then you will not be able to reach him,

../../input/johnoliver/wav/07598.wav|they found that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07599.wav|middle of the night in her own
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07600.wav|place in america but estimates
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07601.wav|whether they're throwing a grenade into
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07603.wav|a surprise drug raid at his home
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07604.wav|to get the search warrant that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07605.wav|tonight the difference
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07607.wav|don't have to work very hard
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07611.wav|no due diligence and handcuffed her
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07612.wav|they often don't spend much time
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07615.wav|while more than percent of the cases
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07617.wav|is barely there as a judge in georgia
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07618.wav|knocked on his door so in hindsight
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07619.wav|black communities
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07621.wav|trust you to determine who's a good kid
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07622.wav|for two months and there was a minivan
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07623.wav|have to sign off on warrants and ideally
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07625.wav|for money or leniency and a lot of those
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07626.wav|and again they were looking for drugs
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07627.wav|work on the front end
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07628.wav|you're in call of duty
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07629.wav|instead the community has to live with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07630.wav|there from the officer's mad dash like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07633.wav|electronically submitted warrants
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07634.wav|over whether or not police officers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07635.wav|all the time and troublingly police
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07636.wav|door comes in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07638.wav|botched raids usually aren't even
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07640.wav|that ranged from the horrific to the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07641.wav|take a look at one particularly extreme
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07643.wav|when you are handcuffed naked in your
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07644.wav|just being handed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07645.wav|that guy looks like a bit of a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07646.wav|should only be used as a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07647.wav|investigation that found
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07648.wav|cbs in chicago did an investigation of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07649.wav|disorienting and for the people who are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07650.wav|allegedly injuring an officer in the leg
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07651.wav|what he was still cuffed to a chair if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07652.wav|oh for sake it is humiliating to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07653.wav|or people yell sheriff's office and the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07656.wav|like this video of them looking for a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07657.wav|have no choice but to internalize the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07658.wav|full of belligerent arseholes and lots
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07661.wav|degrees so you'd hope officers would
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07662.wav|consequences a times investigation found
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07664.wav|and that they'd observed the interaction
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07666.wav|the knowledge that no space is truly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07667.wav|federal agents to swat teams within
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07668.wav|and raids can obviously have dire
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07669.wav|recommends that raids never be used to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07670.wav|pitch perfect crashed into the wire and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07671.wav|there really aren't a lot of limits on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07672.wav|yeah it is they broke into her home
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07673.wav|almost anyone in law enforcement from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07674.wav|be really careful with them certainly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07678.wav|you raids happen in real time
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07679.wav|increasingly loudly so let me quickly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07682.wav|because he had national attention
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07683.wav|from a very young age so what do we do
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07685.wav|cop rock a very real musical cop show
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07686.wav|and when they did find the man that they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07687.wav|disparity has been found again
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07688.wav|course when it comes to police raids so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07690.wav|appear sweeping
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07691.wav|we've certainly got no reason not to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07694.wav|if we can do the right thing here and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07695.wav|that is absurd even the cases on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07696.wav|can be pretty limited after brianna
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07697.wav|often exacerbated by how targets of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07698.wav|a no knock raid and a knock and announce
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07699.wav|into a crib and look i'm no policeman
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07700.wav|the police blow open the door of the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07702.wav|and police have sometimes been caught
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07703.wav|with what you probably know already
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07705.wav|they would function as a check here but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07706.wav|and equips officers like that the lead
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07707.wav|they said you don't have to shout
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07708.wav|even when they raise the wrong residence
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07709.wav|and who fought hard to get the body
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07710.wav|and if the police are truly incapable of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07712.wav|because the police screwed up a search
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07713.wav|rolled into one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07714.wav|belligerent but the thing is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07716.wav|that we didn't give military grade
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07717.wav|warrants in washington dc found
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07718.wav|take flashbang grenades in theory they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07719.wav|by the mystery of more than one house
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07720.wav|going to be safe
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07721.wav|to get a warrant to blow someone's door
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07722.wav|and minimal judicial oversight on the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07724.wav|police departments have become heavily
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07728.wav|only in this case the keys are a man the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07729.wav|security camera they asked him
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07730.wav|this country is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07734.wav|and then walking away and look normally
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07735.wav|shots into her home a year later
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07736.wav|wild overuse of raids then and only then
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07737.wav|injured or traumatized
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07739.wav|to detectives and patrol officers while
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07740.wav|you're just a nice talkative guy who
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07742.wav|and all the black and brown people who
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07743.wav|take angenette young a social worker in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07744.wav|this job is fun and police might point
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07747.wav|was sentenced to and a half years in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07748.wav|right in the face and that is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07750.wav|like jessica chastain and on top of all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07751.wav|before eventually throwing a blanket
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07752.wav|even when they violate the rules
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07753.wav|address and that business is just pure
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07754.wav|raid so they could see how it looked
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07755.wav|we'd have a police story legitimately
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07759.wav|once police have one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07760.wav|you show up with settlers of catan and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07763.wav|valuable goldfish
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07765.wav|were longer than seconds and it was a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07766.wav|militarized police culture that trains
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07769.wav|senator got in trouble for saying
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07770.wav|and these tactics are rarely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07771.wav|as we've discussed on the show before
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07772.wav|if you just smell marijuana you don't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07774.wav|why they really shouldn't be and what we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07775.wav|lives are getting destroyed through
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07776.wav|or indeed dale mounting a hypothetical
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07778.wav|one analysis found that only seven
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07779.wav|and that is fundamentally the same it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07781.wav|over her while she was still handcuffed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07782.wav|and disorient people but they can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07784.wav|which is that not all of us
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07785.wav|our main story tonight concerns policing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07786.wav|in the wake of the brianna taylor okay
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07789.wav|is that it can encourage them to then
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07792.wav|war on drugs and the tactic became so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07793.wav|is reasonable because you might flush
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07794.wav|can come from anywhere whether it's the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07795.wav|medium security prison in another
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07796.wav|police raids it's a practice that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07797.wav|exercise for swat team members
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07798.wav|happy anniversary please enjoy this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07802.wav|to conduct a search and i know there's a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07803.wav|found that half the time judges approved
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07804.wav|signed off in less than seconds
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07806.wav|really need access to that kind of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07807.wav|a crib maybe they shouldn't have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07808.wav|that does not mean that no damage is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07809.wav|serve narcotics warrants saying
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07810.wav|keys only to discover they were in your
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07811.wav|attracted a lot of attention last year
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07813.wav|now i'd say that was the best worst
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07814.wav|raids are treated
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07815.wav|cocaine but despite not finding any
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07816.wav|you we're just high-fiving ourselves for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07817.wav|show on quibby
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07818.wav|is hard to say exactly how many take
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07820.wav|in less than three minutes with hundreds
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07822.wav|and i'd argue that there's a big
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07823.wav|if you throw either of them into a crib
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07825.wav|up or just because the song told them to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07826.wav|to geraldo's ridiculous disguise which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07829.wav|and police really aren't incentivized to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07830.wav|guns they also have supposedly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07831.wav|stop it and if that sounds extreme you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07832.wav|evidence down the toilet which does
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07833.wav|battering ram and maybe just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07834.wav|they deserve the respect and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07835.wav|for anyone involved and right now raids
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07836.wav|carry out those warrants with increasing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07839.wav|let's talk about them why they are such
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07840.wav|yeah the ruling there was giving you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07841.wav|the baby merchant
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07842.wav|can still use the evidence obtained
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07845.wav|manages to deliver to the correct
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07846.wav|unless someone is accused of trafficking
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07847.wav|anything else that couple just stands
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07848.wav|tally had a doorbell cam that showed the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07849.wav|took place in little rock here
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07850.wav|being such a good sport about this even
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07852.wav|such squares and the thing is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07853.wav|watch a train tactical unit outfitted
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07855.wav|completely naked
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07856.wav|even produced a special where he showed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07857.wav|they're going to be called to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07858.wav|we'll say that is still better than his
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07859.wav|grenade into a crib
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07860.wav|zip code so when you have bad police
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07861.wav|off on a search warrant is pretty low
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07862.wav|criminally charged and even more rarely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07864.wav|norris a year old with heart problems
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07867.wav|chaotic evil
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07869.wav|solution here that's actually staring us
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07870.wav|have a phd in grenadology but purely as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07872.wav|sounds good the thing is as you've seen
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07873.wav|not to throw it into a crib but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07874.wav|watching we'll see you next week
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07875.wav|and people are yelling sheriff's office
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07876.wav|was like the pringles guy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07877.wav|police departments
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07879.wav|all you need is probable cause or a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07881.wav|family had lived at that address
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07883.wav|proportional to the alleged crimes being
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07884.wav|an opportunity for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07885.wav|and a good lawyer meanwhile year old
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07886.wav|there are real consequences to those
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07887.wav|be flushed away in seconds
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07888.wav|louisville and virginia which initially
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07889.wav|both for the individuals who are killed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07891.wav|why the are we raiding people's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07892.wav|unacceptable when the stakes are so high
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07893.wav|sure that's just a one-off but the thing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07894.wav|is a message that is received loud and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07895.wav|military-grade equipment you say as you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07896.wav|it's one of tv's favorite subjects from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07900.wav|rule that applies to both horseshoes and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07901.wav|seconds to answer your door
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07902.wav|warrant application or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07903.wav|replace all those babies well don't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07906.wav|it's incredibly difficult to watch you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07907.wav|and i apologize for even attempting this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07908.wav|busting into someone's home is never
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07910.wav|alabaster prim
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07911.wav|for three human minutes that show was on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07912.wav|what they can do just about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07913.wav|flavorless crucified melon now amazingly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07914.wav|thinking here but john if there is a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07916.wav|door in but you get it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07917.wav|leader baby murders do they think
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07919.wav|they were almost exclusively executed in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07920.wav|be that surprising
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07921.wav|hours after brianna taylor was killed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07924.wav|several years worth of search warrants
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07928.wav|certain neighborhoods tended to be hit a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07929.wav|generate heat in excess of

../../input/johnoliver/wav/07933.wav|equipment to people who can't be trusted
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07934.wav|really glad he had one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07937.wav|the word of a confidential informant who
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07939.wav|involved or there's a lawsuit and even
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07940.wav|mistakes like that happen all the time
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07941.wav|in an action movie
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07942.wav|having done next to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07943.wav|led to the raid on roderick talley's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07944.wav|tips turn out to be complete
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07945.wav|shouting what
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07947.wav|well that's pretty embarrassing but i
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07948.wav|there were absolutely no survivors
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07949.wav|well i would argue that small changes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07950.wav|armed resistance to a police raid
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07954.wav|of them have guns
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07955.wav|those charges were dropped but only
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07956.wav|your home upside down looking for your
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07957.wav|community you're supposed to be serving
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07958.wav|sounding place names
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07959.wav|area of policing in particular tonight
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07960.wav|raid he would shoot them dead
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07964.wav|after he injured a police officer during
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07965.wav|should do about that and let's start
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07966.wav|might be trading tips
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07967.wav|now you're probably just currently
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07968.wav|from the threat of police violence that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07969.wav|decision whether or not to defend
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07970.wav|i have seen more cop rock there's a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07971.wav|apartment belonging to a man named
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07972.wav|before the raid that killed her
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07975.wav|active shooters or hostage situations
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07977.wav|somewhere else that they probably should
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07979.wav|requiring them to knock announce and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07980.wav|they could re-watch the footage of their
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07981.wav|guess it's kind of like when you turn
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07982.wav|far too widely and are destroying lives
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07983.wav|apparently roots for the wolf
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07984.wav|hand grenades
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07985.wav|is not the drastic measure being taken
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07986.wav|or compensating residents for any other
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07988.wav|with military hardware get so completely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07989.wav|worth of cookies from subway don't be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07993.wav|police raids were supercharged by the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07997.wav|stop doing drug raids just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/07999.wav|lessons of that trauma
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08000.wav|i'm not a big fan of doorbell cams
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08002.wav|stream for kids
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08004.wav|grenades here is another quick
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08005.wav|the sounds of an armed invasion
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08006.wav|television
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08008.wav|police told a judge that a confidential
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08009.wav|raising the home of his neighbor henry
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08010.wav|i'm not saying you should seek it out
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08011.wav|militarized after either purchasing or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08016.wav|officers were required to verify
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08017.wav|and when you treat people like that it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08019.wav|because look i'm not saying that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08020.wav|seriously it's three minutes long it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08021.wav|edison park museum campus and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08023.wav|even edible arrangements
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08024.wav|actually in the home they're raiding or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08027.wav|too easy to get a search warrant and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08029.wav|smell of marijuana or very often
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08030.wav|are they different
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08031.wav|he knew he was shooting at police
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08032.wav|almost cartoonishly idiotic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08033.wav|smurfs or stealing the world's most
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08034.wav|lot more often than
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08035.wav|he surrendered peacefully when officers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08036.wav|that's our show thank you so much for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08037.wav|between no knock and knock is basically

../../input/johnoliver/wav/08043.wav|that evidence of a crime will be found
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08045.wav|to the fact that they don't just use

../../input/johnoliver/wav/08048.wav|put it in the tens of thousands per year

../../input/johnoliver/wav/08246.wav|in the supreme court ruled that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08248.wav|and even if nobody gets physically hurt
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08250.wav|one of his toys in a career day live
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08252.wav|decisions like that mean the distinction
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08253.wav|any party but in this instance i'm
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08255.wav|show up with loaded assault rifles like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08256.wav|for paying to repair a broken front door
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08257.wav|for drugs and he's right drug raids
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08258.wav|checking to see if their suspect is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08261.wav|liability by the doctrine of qualified
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08262.wav|yeah exactly and the police hitting the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08263.wav|i've ever heard right up there with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08267.wav|they all seem to be having a lot of fun
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08271.wav|exactly episodes think of it like if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08272.wav|and you might be thinking oh come on i'm
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08274.wav|magnificent mile are some of the whitest
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08275.wav|that really means anything
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08276.wav|so there is often no meaningful
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08279.wav|hill street blues
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08281.wav|if police raided his home in a no-knock
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08282.wav|actions if not death

../../input/johnoliver/wav/08284.wav|was charged with attempted murder
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08285.wav|just aren't going to cut it here because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08286.wav|are at equal danger of being raided when
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08287.wav|for firing his gun during the raid and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08288.wav|for those who actually do get raided
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08290.wav|only the wolf had possessed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08291.wav|just absurd look this is obviously
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08292.wav|these tactics were initially intended
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08293.wav|involved searches for

../../input/johnoliver/wav/08300.wav|were actually looking for at a different

../../input/johnoliver/wav/08307.wav|no difference at all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08309.wav|were harder to get and

../../input/johnoliver/wav/08312.wav|on marijuana
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08314.wav|expect although i will say you didn't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08315.wav|they shouldn't be prepared for cult
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08316.wav|an investigation in utah of more than
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08317.wav|having your home violated is a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08318.wav|there often aren't consequences for

../../input/johnoliver/wav/08321.wav|you were there by the way thanks for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08326.wav|at least civilians were killed in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08330.wav|with racism and we want to focus on one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08331.wav|actually have to tell me that those
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08333.wav|nursery rhyme with a souped-up
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08334.wav|that is just not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08335.wav|investigated
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08336.wav|climb down from our current
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08338.wav|there is just case after case of the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08339.wav|though we do all have guns so you kind
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08340.wav|act that way take a look at a raid that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08341.wav|information from confidential informants
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08342.wav|apart bryce dallas howard is the one who
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08343.wav|unless someone is killed the media gets
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08345.wav|i'm pretty sure i know a guy who can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08347.wav|intentional policy choices
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08348.wav|walking up to the door alone standing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08350.wav|knock and no knock is very very thin
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08352.wav|try to hide how much they enjoy using it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08353.wav|in america but as long as we've been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08354.wav|indicted for charges relating to her
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08356.wav|chance the conspiracy theorists stumble
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08357.wav|the chant of believe all women
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08360.wav|g rollout and initially
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08361.wav|not actually from her arrest at all it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08362.wav|only time an english person should be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08365.wav|and be empathetic meet them where they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08366.wav|and it deploys those techniques to tell
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08367.wav|angrily demands hospital staff show him
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08368.wav|because make no mistake here
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08370.wav|tend not to like that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08371.wav|might personally benefit from and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08372.wav|the police surrounding her house using
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08374.wav|loves to unleash them into the world and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08375.wav|individuals to try and spot these
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08377.wav|than anyone could have imagined
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08379.wav|people to keep quiet and would have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08380.wav|simply worked a little harder and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08383.wav|saying bye bye mama is when they're
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08384.wav|to be the depressing guy that tells you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08385.wav|the more they believed that she was

../../input/johnoliver/wav/08390.wav|these criticisms of pandemic will
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08392.wav|is not by shaming them for believing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08397.wav|that he's spreading he's only interested
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08400.wav|makes it almost impossible for them to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08401.wav|well what if all of them are in on the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08403.wav|but asking in a country that marches to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08404.wav|will both be where there are a lot of

../../input/johnoliver/wav/08411.wav|led to videos like this one where a man

../../input/johnoliver/wav/08493.wav|social media companies are finally doing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08494.wav|some intent there and experts will say
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08495.wav|looks like a map of coronavirus
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08496.wav|days to go through why each one of those
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08498.wav|perfect storm for conspiracy theorists
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08499.wav|and urged people to expose the truth
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08500.wav|so much wrong there but most of all the

../../input/johnoliver/wav/08562.wav|people who have been convinced that

../../input/johnoliver/wav/08565.wav|millions of fake votes were cast for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08569.wav|every weeknight to calmly tell them what
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08570.wav|thanks to the internet can spread with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08572.wav|narrative where she claims
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08573.wav|these theories have always been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08574.wav|actually three basic questions that you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08577.wav|in just one week it was viewed over
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08578.wav|one study found that more participants
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08580.wav|in amplifying whatever he thinks he
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08583.wav|in and newspaper claims the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08584.wav|true by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08586.wav|agree with them and if you're thinking
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08588.wav|and that is a theory that led to this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08589.wav|they don't always have the expertise to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08590.wav|to think a bit more critically so to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08591.wav|and that i'll try to learn to say it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08592.wav|is there a rational non-conspiracy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08593.wav|high budget true crime documentary with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08594.wav|fever diarrhea and covito but not in the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08597.wav|before you take into account that one of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08599.wav|them and what you might be able to do
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08600.wav|debunked claim that covert death rates
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08602.wav|when it's not only easier for people to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08604.wav|doctor or scientist like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08610.wav|who had to keep them secret they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08611.wav|unsatisfying so people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08612.wav|may know people who do and while you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08613.wav|the hard way so what can we do here well
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08618.wav|only a fraction of americans succumbing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08619.wav|because she's telling people good
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08620.wav|then flipping the bird and dancing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08621.wav|has got something to say to them too
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08622.wav|and that scientists are covering it up
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08623.wav|ease and all of this would be dangerous
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08625.wav|is this conspiracy as a practical matter
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08626.wav|a lot more sense because that's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08629.wav|that end we've asked some people that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08630.wav|century conspiracy theorists claim that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08631.wav|disbelieve doctor mykovitz to which the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08634.wav|which is a shockingly high number
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08635.wav|charges and when a reporter pointed this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08636.wav|that is our show thank you so much for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08637.wav|there is real harm in throwing gasoline
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08638.wav|one study pointed out
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08641.wav|be careful with what they encounter and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08643.wav|consistently endorse at least one sort
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08648.wav|somehow be further proof
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08652.wav|such as social distancing so tonight
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08654.wav|and the problem is some online theories
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08655.wav|technically alive at the same time
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08656.wav|because the point of that movement is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08658.wav|during a pandemic go
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08661.wav|can only do so much
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08662.wav|adding i've been confused for a decade
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08664.wav|crazy although if there is one expert on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08665.wav|exact same way as the coronavirus
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08667.wav|confused that man is whenever he tries
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08668.wav|although i will simply say this if i am
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08669.wav|completely natural to simply want to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08670.wav|theory that the cdc and the media
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08671.wav|the ones that come up in the weeks and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08673.wav|i don't think he's going to be the last
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08675.wav|yeah we got alex trebek to make a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08676.wav|shook the world and the very idea that a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08679.wav|as a whistleblower on the scientific
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08680.wav|i don't know if you've ever tried to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08681.wav|it's going to be incumbent upon us as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08685.wav|phrased it when they turned that switch
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08694.wav|not only saying that he stands behind it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08699.wav|innately appealing and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08701.wav|current pandemic is coming in the age of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08702.wav|i called your uncle a and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08704.wav|these beliefs are dangerous even if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08705.wav|their coronavirus patients and then
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08706.wav|about it and let's start with the fact
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08709.wav|later filed over the arrest
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08711.wav|a few things you should know first she
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08712.wav|spreading coronavirus
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08715.wav|the idea that wearing a mask activates
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08716.wav|could cause such chaos was inherently
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08717.wav|well i guess we all have to take rachel
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08718.wav|less impactful events have attracted
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08720.wav|believe that princess diana faked her
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08722.wav|and those theories are just the tip of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08724.wav|sun that burns your skin
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08725.wav|conspiracy theories voted definitely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08726.wav|claims like obama was born in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08729.wav|were exaggerated because it was all over
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08730.wav|your own virus is absurd in debunking it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08733.wav|surprising something which is also
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08734.wav|the story of judy mykovitz
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08735.wav|of conspiratorial narrative and look
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08736.wav|now what experts say is that the most
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08738.wav|rush limbaugh gets it and that's a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08743.wav|images like these showing maps of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08745.wav|they might be more willing to listen to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08746.wav|that means my puppet master is a t and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08749.wav|physically leaving the womb
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08751.wav|will give you a dry cough
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08753.wav|experts and if so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08754.wav|assortment of truly beloved figures from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08755.wav|support this and then through in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08757.wav|as for the idea that there are healing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08758.wav|out to be true but the very fact that we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08762.wav|states because he's been spreading them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08764.wav|antonin scalia was murdered and that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08766.wav|than the clip they chose it's also
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08767.wav|still lingers because it felt too big an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08768.wav|remember the theory g towers are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08769.wav|saying them and he's just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08772.wav|with a hodgepodge of conspiracy theories
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08773.wav|how quickly other science-based
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08777.wav|created as a bio weapon or what about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08780.wav|familiar with at least some conspiracy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08781.wav|matching a piano's pitch
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08785.wav|looking to start a conversation with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08786.wav|edward snowden's revelations about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08787.wav|delivery and after that is yes mom no
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08794.wav|because that means it's been seen more
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08796.wav|revealing that conversely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08798.wav|for theories to cite a single source a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08799.wav|the pandemic was being exaggerated
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08804.wav|mom and thank you kindly for wiping off
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08807.wav|that the film misrepresents mike ovitz's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08808.wav|some worrying real world actions take
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08810.wav|only scratching the surface of what is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08812.wav|fast and furious movies well the good
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08813.wav|made messages to urge people to think
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08814.wav|lots of maps look like those maps this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08816.wav|called proportionality bias
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08817.wav|what did those experts say because it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08819.wav|just show them this piece but obviously
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08820.wav|expression even is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08821.wav|it's sand that goes down your ass crack
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08822.wav|when you search house raid on a stock
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08828.wav|every conspiracy theory is fictional
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08829.wav|why they're so appealing how to spot
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08830.wav|or the argument that the earth is flat
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08831.wav|fancy graphics and drone footage
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08832.wav|that news outlets have repeatedly called
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08837.wav|kovid was overblown have sometimes paid
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08839.wav|loveless marriage with prince charles
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08840.wav|severely midwest and diane keaton here
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08841.wav|because their theories are now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08844.wav|something being demonstrably dead yet
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08845.wav|over three and a half years which does
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08847.wav|shoehorned lyrics and the bad adele or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08849.wav|attempting autoerotic asphyxiation in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08850.wav|every birthday and it's not just alex
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08852.wav|and the harms of conspiracy theories
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08855.wav|this video of two doctors making a now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08856.wav|of conspiracy theories is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08858.wav|just this week when he retweeted a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08860.wav|contradict one another
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08861.wav|someone is telling roxanne no matter how
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08864.wav|and he's been doing this throughout the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08865.wav|politifact said there is no evidence to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08867.wav|i was talking about toilet transmitted
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08869.wav|the months ahead the fact is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08870.wav|often with the excuse that people are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08872.wav|factual inaccuracies slant rhymes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08874.wav|obviously some have absolutely turned
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08878.wav|organize say a midsize surprise party
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08880.wav|news is john cena
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08882.wav|solid bjork impression
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08885.wav|at thetruetruetruth.com and if you're
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08886.wav|actually created an equation to predict
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08887.wav|possible for them to make material look
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08888.wav|buildings and deeply tragic adult
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08889.wav|conspiracy theories would have unraveled
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08890.wav|exactly it made the rounds helped by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08892.wav|appealing and have actually been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08893.wav|that actually brings us to our final
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08894.wav|i'm going to share this around the world
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08895.wav|evidence that the whole thing is bigger
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08896.wav|is and it still won't address
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08899.wav|science now the second question you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08901.wav|would have to be sworn to secrecy to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08902.wav|conspiracies are sort of like ugly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08905.wav|keep a coronavirus hoax under wraps
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08906.wav|startlingly authoritative in fact
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08907.wav|or as that one woman so memorably
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08908.wav|outbreaks and i'm pretty sure domino's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08910.wav|question here how plausible
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08915.wav|perhaps understandably reached for a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08917.wav|we're not sure what a coronavirus
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08918.wav|times than this tick tock of a cat
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08919.wav|that that is actually a huge draw of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08921.wav|outbreak and in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08922.wav|the tagline for feminism and the appeal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08923.wav|conspiracy when they can barely pull off
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08924.wav|then refuse to take responsibility for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08932.wav|is the current president of the united
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08934.wav|holy crap this is amazing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08935.wav|that thinks the royal family had
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08938.wav|actually a common trait
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08939.wav|given the transmissibility of covid
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08942.wav|they may not listen to me but they might
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08945.wav|believe women not believe all women and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08947.wav|how would they even be sending me orders
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08953.wav|of conspiracy theories is such that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08954.wav|facebook a couple of months ago or maybe
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08956.wav|person with the clearest sense
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08959.wav|an unrelated swat raid and is literally
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08960.wav|bye bye mama thank you for an excellent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08961.wav|event to be accidental there had to be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08962.wav|presents a key moment in michael vicks's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08968.wav|the conspiracy theorist in chief
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08970.wav|reason that we need to talk about this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08972.wav|and that's not just objectively better
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08973.wav|coronavirus cases alongside maps of the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08975.wav|to them ignore best practices
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08979.wav|coronavis prevention involves
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08981.wav|to check into a hotel
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08982.wav|effective way to approach someone
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08985.wav|that what it's saying is true that is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08986.wav|on them we've put their full videos
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08987.wav|that's actually been a challenge for us
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08989.wav|is and isn't correct
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08990.wav|share online so you can show your
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08991.wav|unchallenged batshit medical claims like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08993.wav|the iceberg here you might have seen
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08995.wav|far beyond confused hospital workers as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/08997.wav|picking one of these videos is honestly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09001.wav|the point is these theories can be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09004.wav|looked at real government secrets like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09007.wav|the beach is exactly three things none
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09008.wav|big causes take the jfk assassination
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09010.wav|backstory it's that in doing so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09012.wav|coronavirus but i will say
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09013.wav|the similarity there does seem striking
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09015.wav|that these theories are a lot more
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09019.wav|second while that arrest footage looks
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09022.wav|popular than you might think
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09023.wav|over half of americans
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09026.wav|microbes at the beach look i don't want
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09028.wav|trump has passed on so many conspiracies
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09031.wav|a former scientist at the national
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09033.wav|do bad research and spread their results
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09035.wav|person in this country to learn that a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09037.wav|let's talk about conspiracy theories
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09039.wav|before we believe them or indeed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09041.wav|after some claims that the severity of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09042.wav|gently urging anyone who watches it to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09044.wav|one man suddenly changing the world is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09045.wav|bill gates's plan to microchip me and it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09047.wav|people can even embrace ones that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09048.wav|which is the tendency to assume that big
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09050.wav|say you've got a cousin who's not a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09051.wav|this best western and tell him your sign
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09052.wav|why is it that people are so quick to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09056.wav|in on this conspiracy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09057.wav|and treat them with a skeptical eye
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09058.wav|masked robber spanking himself
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09059.wav|who came up with the pringles tube
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09061.wav|dodging our question here we're truly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09062.wav|we do know is that his head looks like a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09063.wav|problem to which pringles responded
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09064.wav|when is michael keaton going to win an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09065.wav|choice is yours do the right pring here
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09066.wav|because i know so many other pointless
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09067.wav|they've also tweeted mixed breeze
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09068.wav|now a few of you knew exactly how good
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09069.wav|more why is pringles
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09070.wav|ten thousand dollars to feeding america
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09071.wav|hi there internet i'm john oliver host
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09072.wav|illuminating drawings like this one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09073.wav|meet the fda's definition
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09074.wav|of a potato chip which is pretty wild
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09077.wav|which seems to have combined the head of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09078.wav|but still they are my favorite is this a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09079.wav|weren't looking for a refund
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09081.wav|but we wanted to come back for a minute
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09082.wav|offensive i'm just not entirely sure why
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09084.wav|perfectly fine joke there because there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09086.wav|because after our show aired people went
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09087.wav|to give you a quick update on something
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09088.wav|they don't maintain an active twitter
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09089.wav|not asking
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09091.wav|is it hermit pring
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09094.wav|but not the one thing that i really want
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09095.wav|and all of that makes me wonder even
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09096.wav|tweeted at them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09097.wav|mascot's official name is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09098.wav|about that joke again
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09099.wav|remember that towards the end of the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09100.wav|direction like this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09101.wav|slender man mr pringles or this one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09102.wav|of puppies which actually feels
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09103.wav|but it seems that a lot of you did
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09104.wav|spectacular piece portraying him as an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09105.wav|out of their way to either draw or find
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09106.wav|information so we can get this handled
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09107.wav|with nipples in the belly button drawn
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09108.wav|presence they've tweeted before
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09109.wav|point it would have been just as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09110.wav|like this leave the man alone at that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09111.wav|isolating year it was genuinely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09112.wav|this picture of the pringles man is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09113.wav|what people feel the pringles guide does
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09114.wav|known as mouth crisp
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09115.wav|not one not two but three
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09116.wav|puppies i like the flavor stack
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09117.wav|a choice i also know that pringles calls
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09119.wav|doesn't sit well with me is just how
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09120.wav|wondering if that is a problem
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09121.wav|excellent others went in a different
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09122.wav|this one captured
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09123.wav|sense paying a price

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09163.wav|this meaning you are in a very real
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09164.wav|is it this hot daddy pring i'd prefer if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09165.wav|a lot that we don't know about the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09166.wav|probably watch on youtube for free
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09168.wav|honestly the whole response has been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09169.wav|and i know that they respond to people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09170.wav|its product a crisp
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09171.wav|absolutely fantastic the only thing that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09173.wav|captioned mr pringle's nipple reveal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09174.wav|because you tweeted a variety of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09175.wav|or are you talking days now that was a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09176.wav|thriving armpit hair a look that just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09177.wav|the ball is in your court guys the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09178.wav|look like from the neck down and at the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09179.wav|facts about pringles i know that their
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09180.wav|please send us a dm with your contact
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09181.wav|pringle he ready to mingle if that is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09182.wav|bit like throw up
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09184.wav|oscar or what does the rest of the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09185.wav|uplifting to see
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09186.wav|for a reason and that is that they don't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09187.wav|that person wasn't even complaining they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09188.wav|silent pringles has been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09189.wav|excellent pringles bods
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09191.wav|the reason i know that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09192.wav|when will penguins learn how to fly or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09193.wav|yes very badly so much so that i'm
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09194.wav|the drawings that you found were like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09195.wav|because even on youtube you do have to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09196.wav|end of such a depressing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09198.wav|unemployed chippendale and there was an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09199.wav|now we're still on hiatus at the moment
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09200.wav|pringles new slogan they're exactly as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09202.wav|still no answer to our very basic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09203.wav|because it's a garbage snack it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09204.wav|maybe free isn't quite the right word
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09205.wav|and i honestly didn't really think much
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09206.wav|capture notes i've dedicated the last
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09207.wav|excellent renderings of a body positive
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09208.wav|election results would come in that he
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09209.wav|that basic definition my point here is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09210.wav|died he had his ashes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09211.wav|bad a company as i imagine they are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09212.wav|productive to ask him
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09213.wav|don't spend a penny of that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09214.wav|on the condition of course that they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09215.wav|for a lot we've seen a ton of excellent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09216.wav|if we named pringles the same way
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09217.wav|to studying his anatomy and that is time
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09218.wav|or is he completely smooth
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09221.wav|hard-boiled egg disguised as tom selleck
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09222.wav|because i've seen it once someone
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09223.wav|there was this depiction of a portly mr
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09224.wav|pringle guy's body look like is he tall
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09225.wav|julius pringles working with from the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09227.wav|of last week tonight a show that you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09228.wav|football got its name pringles would be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09229.wav|artist who sent us
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09232.wav|was so proud of his design that when he
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09233.wav|looked at potato chips and inexplicably
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09234.wav|also the shorts of a sexual predator
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09235.wav|and i will say this he's single he
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09236.wav|julius pringles and i know that the guy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09237.wav|true we can disagree on whether those
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09238.wav|level maybe something like on Graham
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09240.wav|oh and Henry Ford but ledger isn't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09241.wav|bioweapon in a North Carolina laboratory
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09243.wav|Jake Gyllenhaal and since its birth Oh
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09247.wav|turns out you can hire a hitman for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09249.wav|nurture and grow our word realms we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09250.wav|even after I have explosive diarrhea I'm
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09251.wav|the president than Fox we thought
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09253.wav|wheeler hadn't posted that video last
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09255.wav|only one of them is growing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09256.wav|come back to that question once
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09257.wav|justified his argument like this I would
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09258.wav|absolutely be weird enough even if Liz
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09260.wav|last week tonight is for some reason
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09261.wav|course of seconds she spins an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09263.wav|country and it's wit like that that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09264.wav|she boosted a conspiracy theory that the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09265.wav|confirmed coronavirus cases in the u.s.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09267.wav|already know shanell Rhian Oh a ins
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09270.wav|implore you to ignore a news network
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09271.wav|being submitted nor have we received the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09272.wav|just calling it may seem crude
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09274.wav|yourself on roots to your secret

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09277.wav|still busy fighting in World War two
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09278.wav|contagious now when Chanel Rhian isn't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09281.wav|this week in which he claimed that it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09282.wav|on right the now but by all means

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09284.wav|lowest rated show on Fox News actually
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09286.wav|describe a sentence like that thankfully
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09287.wav|lobster's fool you and look it's not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09289.wav|yeah he signs off that way
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09290.wav|conservative millionaire and son droids
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09291.wav|at one point when he didn't like Shep

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09297.wav|mainly that and third if we were living
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09298.wav|a pelican swallows me whole look I love
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09299.wav|head it seems excellent but if Trump
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09300.wav|when you hear the kinds of questions
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09302.wav|for the media but he's also been holding
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09303.wav|the network's only bright lights you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09304.wav|should probably be the one that we focus
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09305.wav|then it wasn't nice but if it's one that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09307.wav|still full of why would you admit
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09308.wav|important that his twitter followers see
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09310.wav|Rich's murder last year they traveled
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09312.wav|it's that toxic things that start small
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09313.wav|anchorman esque parody of right-wing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09314.wav|and wrong and not in significant part of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09315.wav|that should absolutely not be your
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09317.wav|you want to say something that implies
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09318.wav|that argument is a walk I assume that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09319.wav|the times that it wore black face in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09320.wav|you're not then of course this is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09321.wav|certain Ron Burgundy flair watch as he
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09322.wav|passed, Trump thought it was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09323.wav|times you can laugh at an almost

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09325.wav|network has actively given airtime to

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09333.wav|brief instant before that feeling like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09334.wav|ledger and remember anything can be food
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09335.wav|into something very different we should
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09336.wav|saying is you wouldn't be keeping great
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09337.wav|an argument just watch as over the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09338.wav|dates that she wasn't assigned a seat
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09339.wav|$, reward for information on Seth

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09353.wav|Americans to defy the government's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09354.wav|big Trump favorite and she can develop
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09355.wav|she uses that same chain argument logic

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09359.wav|Graham ledger has explicitly called for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09360.wav|for everything ask yourself this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09361.wav|thank you so much yeah he retweeted that

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09363.wav|desire a more eloquent plea let me offer
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09364.wav|company even if you were in there which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09365.wav|of one is if a nice question is meant to

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09368.wav|fantastic exchange are you binge
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09369.wav|single second although when you put it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09370.wav|just know we're about to find out all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09373.wav|things are equivalent they're not but if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09376.wav|supporters Oh a yen calls and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09377.wav|so for all of those of you who might
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09378.wav|the time it would make just as much
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09379.wav|one day announced my tragic death after
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09380.wav|White House pressroom being called on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09382.wav|right on the head this website is so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09383.wav|people on TV don't always look
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09384.wav|ledger online he's even worse just watch
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09386.wav|so flagrantly smitten with Trump that at
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09387.wav|media you know the people who announced
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09389.wav|last week even as the number of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09390.wav|Thursday in the midst of a pandemic Oh a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09391.wav|dismiss away in as just a stupid little
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09392.wav|correspondents rushed to his defense
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09393.wav|anchorman - it's just not the right time
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09394.wav|personal grooming other stuff too but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09397.wav|are locked and the PC police are not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09398.wav|every night and for the record we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09399.wav|tonight it may be worth taking a look at
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09400.wav|all the time and are more supportive for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09401.wav|the problem here is the kind of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09402.wav|which is highlighted the fact there is

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09405.wav|at me trust me second Hitler didn't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09406.wav|some great reviews which would
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09407.wav|that is a problem because in the best of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09409.wav|unfathomable avoid that yawns within him
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09411.wav|a video that he posted on Tuesday
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09412.wav|always then yeah it was a very nice
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09413.wav|every show with his signature
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09414.wav|tweeted president Trump recently gave a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09415.wav|will see you next week I'm John Oliver
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09416.wav|that mean Hitler would still be alive
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09417.wav|guess it depends on what your definition
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09418.wav|if you eat it and incidentally that is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09419.wav|it is pretty wild to watch the reactions
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09420.wav|catchphrase even when I'm wrong I'm
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09421.wav|War two still happening and if World War
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09422.wav|conspiracy theories they put up a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09423.wav|referring to the corona virus as the

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09425.wav|Muslim countries if they won't take a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09427.wav|takeaway after watching that show
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09429.wav|administration's ineptitude during a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09430.wav|actually on its way to the Library of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09431.wav|pandemic whether it be a scientist like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09433.wav|floral language like Metanoia Orphic and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09436.wav|who's defending America from terrorists
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09437.wav|outlaw haircuts he was a fascist about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09438.wav|president's putting a lot of energy into
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09439.wav|what's that a nice question though I
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09440.wav|others the monopoly man maybe that's a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09441.wav|all feelings is swallowed up by the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09442.wav|makes the president feel happy for a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09443.wav|Wednesday Rihanna was back in that room
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09444.wav|Rihanna for these people are not just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09445.wav|getting in and if that wasn't sweaty
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09446.wav|and even fewer scruples in fact they're
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09448.wav|Smith's coverage of his administration
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09449.wav|back Fife and kashish which apparently
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09450.wav|weight right now and if they are in the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09451.wav|we probably won't let them in the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09452.wav|points and dirt stupid reporting is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09453.wav|means a face badly in need of punching
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09454.wav|makes him the null coward of meat
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09455.wav|criminal organization as called being
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09456.wav|irresponsible my friends there are a

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09459.wav|media not a single mention of one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09460.wav|archives and they told us and I quote
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09461.wav|why do radical leftists want to expand
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09462.wav|incredibly dangerous at a time like this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09464.wav|this video guess what
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09465.wav|access to a seat in the briefings the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09466.wav|took literally five minutes on Google to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09467.wav|was important that he get his hair cut
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09468.wav|Tigers are surprisingly cheap also it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09469.wav|handy then there is Liz wheeler who is a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09470.wav|catchphrase is it still might be too
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09471.wav|Graham Ledger or a rake fire like Chanel
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09472.wav|the first place don't let polyamorous
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09475.wav|August and we all know the rules here
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09476.wav|into the Library of Congress isn't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09477.wav|and if Hitler is still alive isn't World
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09478.wav|her about page explains that if we don't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09479.wav|seems to be asking the questions that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09480.wav|are still fighting and if our troops are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09481.wav|a lot of press conferences recently
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09484.wav|not essential that you get your hair cut
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09485.wav|lookout for Oh Ann's and to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09486.wav|has health doesn't that mean no one will
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09487.wav|can get big fast and it's dangerous to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09488.wav|they are Fox News with even less shame
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09489.wav|reporters had agreed to take turns
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09490.wav|figure out is presumably somewhere
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09491.wav|either of those things but it might
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09492.wav|investigations there and just recently
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09493.wav|chanel Ryan repeatedly showed up on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09495.wav|sense if his catchphrase was remember
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09496.wav|one point their network account actually
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09497.wav|owen is the brainchild of robert herring
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09498.wav|Association actually revoked Owens
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09499.wav|yet despite having her seat revoked on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09500.wav|may well know someone who watches them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09501.wav|look that says how did I wind up in the

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09720.wav|ever yeah as if things weren't already

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09730.wav|this country long before the pandemic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09731.wav|and everything's being so busy that we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09732.wav|funding because the truth is cities can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09733.wav|we may be about to see evictions on the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09734.wav|their homes and although some cities are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09735.wav|then rents have risen significantly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09736.wav|same way in fact that larry cudlow wife
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09737.wav|extreme crisis some tenants are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09740.wav|states put in place their own
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09741.wav|catastrophe that's actually just around
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09742.wav|how some eviction hearings will be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09743.wav|of your grandmother she lived a long and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09744.wav|no one should ever be trampled by a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09745.wav|to have lower incomes than homeowners in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09747.wav|planned better it's important remember
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09748.wav|the thing that was back in May we're now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09749.wav|virtual happy hour which one of your
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09750.wav|got one and let me tell you the absence
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09753.wav|to take this upstairs now in a much
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09755.wav|it seems there's a new type of Canadian
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09756.wav|who need relief and that is an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09758.wav|have worked with their tenants and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09759.wav|larry cudlow and quick side note here
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09760.wav|have to find a way to keep people in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09761.wav|need a plan to fix our affordable
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09762.wav|to meet the need of all houstonians and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09763.wav|when landlords and property managers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09764.wav|intervention but they have essentially
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09765.wav|where you've begun to despise the house
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09767.wav|dollars disappearing around the same
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09770.wav|$, donation to their local food
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09771.wav|remembering the only thing worse than
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09772.wav|that's America's national trampling
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09774.wav|funding essential city services so they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09777.wav|limited funds at their disposal make it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09778.wav|time but still you know shocking and the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09779.wav|administration's plans back in March
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09780.wav|their income on housing and a quarter
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09781.wav|game I want to murder dinosaur robots
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09782.wav|why are renters consistently the only
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09783.wav|renters and their communities we need to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09784.wav|million dollar rental relief fund and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09785.wav|get on with Arliss and the thing is even
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09786.wav|problem take Houston they established a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09787.wav|are paying percent or more which is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09788.wav|rise and on the list of things you hope
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09789.wav|people out of their homes at the worst
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09790.wav|stuck under the same roof is not knowing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09793.wav|of those moratoriums prevent the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09794.wav|on with our miserable lives
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09795.wav|nearly a decade ago but unfortunately
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09796.wav|stop the legal process that leads up to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09798.wav|one of the company's tenants and just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09799.wav|Fargo just re-establish themselves
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09800.wav|things get really bad they're gonna have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09801.wav|then and only then if I may quote the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09802.wav|cudlow laying out the Trump
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09803.wav|crisis and it's hard to even fathom
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09804.wav|is currently the process of trying to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09805.wav|in a long-term we badly need to solve
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09806.wav|made that argument to a local denver
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09807.wav|stereotype I've previously held because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09808.wav|level they've been linked to heightened
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09809.wav|like finding out that magikarp
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09810.wav|available opportunity I'm notoriously a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09811.wav|no other reason and if everyone was like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09812.wav|attacking this problem with real urgency
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09813.wav|possible time and even in normal times
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09814.wav|everything else they got even worse and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09815.wav|bad enough in the middle of a pandemic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09817.wav|our affordable housing crisis because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09818.wav|count salt rent for those affected by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09819.wav|start and look rent strikes are a risk
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09822.wav|world's rudest Canadian can we all get
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09823.wav|only using because it's not safe for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09824.wav|residential instability substandard
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09825.wav|times when trampling is remotely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09826.wav|it might be a good time to talk about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09828.wav|all of this disproportionately impacts
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09829.wav|faster than incomes to the point where
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09830.wav|color particularly black women are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09831.wav|on everyone being like that guy if for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09833.wav|act people like this woman having to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09834.wav|miserable life and now she'd want us to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09835.wav|but once the pandemic hit like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09836.wav|is a day that we're compounding another
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09837.wav|because to be clear it was a crisis in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09838.wav|evictions undoubtedly helped hold back
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09839.wav|reduced the rent owed or have stepped up
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09840.wav|everyone deserves the basic stability of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09841.wav|simply does not function the same way
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09842.wav|ordered a freeze on evictions for those
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09846.wav|measures like rent strikes we are out
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09847.wav|the problem has only gotten worse since
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09849.wav|on evictions left a lot of people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09850.wav|leaves a lot out of her many paintings
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09851.wav|moving on our main story tonight
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09852.wav|right there that foursome could frankly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09853.wav|because while we wait for Congress to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09854.wav|evicted each year for over a decade and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09856.wav|end any email in happy virtual
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09857.wav|way that he generally thinks speaks and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09859.wav|that none of us have known about in it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09860.wav|next time your landlord asks you for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09861.wav|with Larry King's penis that thing going
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09862.wav|obeyed to the moratoriums they often
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09863.wav|that and while there are clearly no
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09864.wav|nothing because every day we fail to act
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09866.wav|to meet property taxes to go toward
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09867.wav|people of color as black households for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09868.wav|rent due in just three days we thought

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09874.wav|see why many have been pushing for them

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09882.wav|a joyous celebration of the absence of

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09915.wav|this pandemic and it's calling on the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09917.wav|into something else so appalling it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09918.wav|something that can be hard to do with an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09919.wav|co-workers has been secretly rich the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09920.wav|now now that particular Stampede was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09921.wav|emulating that guy some landlords have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09922.wav|for renters below the poverty line the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09924.wav|that isn't just horrifying it also
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09925.wav|because as we've mentioned before on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09926.wav|things the worst thing to happen to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09927.wav|housing crisis in the short term we just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09928.wav|difficult to address the scope of the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09929.wav|most vulnerable unfortunately since then
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09931.wav|chandelier money look the fact is we're
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09933.wav|skipper he couldn't handle the crown
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09934.wav|the hard-hearted bad boy who tells you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09935.wav|Kevin Spacey I should have traded you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09936.wav|played havoc with employment making it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09937.wav|perfect options here the very worst
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09938.wav|at the end of June nothing has been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09939.wav|if what you took from it was no rent no
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09943.wav|Johanna has a chandelier where did she

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09950.wav|with flaming arrows and a want to do it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09951.wav|that the lack of affordable housing is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09952.wav|look the point is the federal moratorium
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09954.wav|now yeah it's shocking to watch
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09955.wav|threaten tenants despite the protections

../../input/johnoliver/wav/09959.wav|over and over and over and over again in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09960.wav|stop this before it gets even worse and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09962.wav|and look sad truth is we've
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09963.wav|especially vulnerable to it so things
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09964.wav|a staple on local news a chaotic scene
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09965.wav|says something about the utter absurdity
../../input/johnoliver/wav/09968.wav|only do so much without federal

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10044.wav|people to leave their homes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10045.wav|long long-term effects on the community
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10047.wav|thought and that their tenants should
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10048.wav|thing is the city of Houston knew
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10049.wav|thinking twice about what you're taking
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10050.wav|when we first brought this up months ago
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10051.wav|have consequences that can haunt you for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10053.wav|deal with the consequences Kiana Ashley
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10054.wav|instance are twice as likely as white
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10055.wav|are not without consequences but you can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10058.wav|families losing their possessions and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10059.wav|this crisis it leaves a lot out much the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10060.wav|one hundred and seventy five million
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10061.wav|horrific outcomes with millions of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10062.wav|no luckily that woman's governor had
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10063.wav|for just a quarter of all rental units
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10064.wav|something to you and that is we actually
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10065.wav|period now that sounds great especially
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10066.wav|yet another systemic problem that the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10067.wav|ones being told that they should have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10068.wav|physical act of eviction but they don't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10069.wav|factory yet and in the face of an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10070.wav|the first place and while stimulus
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10071.wav|actually really important because many
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10073.wav|st of and you're ready for a fresh
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10074.wav|what is happening in that example is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10075.wav|rent meaning that for those unable to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10076.wav|gone the opposite way even trying to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10078.wav|concerns the corona virus among other
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10079.wav|do nothing experts are predicting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10081.wav|the ps comes out I don't care that it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10082.wav|haven't had the chance to reveal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10085.wav|knowing you're gonna spend another day
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10086.wav|that we have a huge Kovach related
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10087.wav|crowd of people out of desperation to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10088.wav|lives my deepest condolences on the loss
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10089.wav|that's very generous but unfortunately
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10090.wav|not safe to reopen the umbrella
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10091.wav|of her husband's clothes specifically
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10092.wav|he's saying there the policy he's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10098.wav|ways you may not even realize from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10099.wav|lives ok whatever you think of that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10100.wav|which is frankly no surprise as multiple
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10104.wav|states with no state-level protection
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10105.wav|graduation now let's get on with our
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10106.wav|it many landlords and property managers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10108.wav|this is what happened fifteen million
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10110.wav|majority are spending more than half of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10112.wav|everyone else for instance for us today
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10113.wav|evicted for non-payment which remember
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10114.wav|soon turn into a full-blown homelessness
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10115.wav|weddings since flashmobs
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10116.wav|some landlords will tell you that the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10117.wav|exclusive release and I will stomp
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10119.wav|difficult for many to make rent which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10121.wav|what if the three kids in question were
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10122.wav|which is already happening in many
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10124.wav|starting to run out or expire and if we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10125.wav|was a freeze on rent payments if you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10126.wav|evictions but that's not actually what
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10127.wav|hold he's moving forward with filing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10128.wav|their homes via zoom a platform you're
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10129.wav|now let's get on with our miserable
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10130.wav|to be right up at the top tide of course
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10131.wav|anyone who stands between me in that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10132.wav|whole time I'm sorry
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10134.wav|so as far as comprehensive plans to stem
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10135.wav|jr. and that single mom was Galen
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10137.wav|landlord his response was pretty
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10138.wav|in that this was going to be an issue
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10139.wav|have clearly been bad for a long time
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10140.wav|good yeah of course it's not good
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10141.wav|tell them that they're mistaken that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10142.wav|now and while long term we desperately
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10145.wav|state and ultimately the federal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10146.wav|affected by Kovac which covered her
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10147.wav|understand this is nowhere near enough
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10150.wav|Wednesday that said I do know the time
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10151.wav|and the reason we're talking about it is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10152.wav|the scale of this crisis back in May to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10153.wav|get rental assistance there are only two
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10154.wav|difficulties in obtaining new housing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10156.wav|households to face eviction and women of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10157.wav|rising is shocking it was also
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10158.wav|holiday and whatever day in the future
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10160.wav|struck with rents so high and renters so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10161.wav|going to be evicted at the first
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10162.wav|have horizon forbidden West as an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10164.wav|interesting idea although again it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10165.wav|what she leaves out is her husband
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10166.wav|they can but at a certain point when
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10167.wav|evictions are incredibly damaging with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10168.wav|news crew who then played the audio to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10169.wav|landlords behavior I will say this that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10171.wav|they're based in the Netherlands and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10172.wav|because they were a mess last
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10173.wav|slap each other in a windowless room
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10174.wav|include the many people who count on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10176.wav|while for many it was when this happened
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10177.wav|absence in people's life so ideally what

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10185.wav|their families and put their lives at

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10188.wav|just make him explain what happened

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10190.wav|of each event will get $, donated to

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10499.wav|its safety measures are as comprehensive
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10500.wav|that man and at this point I don't need

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10502.wav|that WWE their competitor aew is also
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10503.wav|even the Oceanics although frankly

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10515.wav|the overall winner will get a $,

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10519.wav|name to the International Rescue
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10520.wav|pro sports do and therefore they have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10521.wav|a recent earnings call viewers want to

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10529.wav|than ever right now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10531.wav|does best is to bring people together in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10532.wav|and I know that there is currently an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10533.wav|visibly because just think back to the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10534.wav|sure the mother has to be there but that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10535.wav|their -part Michael Jordan documentary
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10537.wav|still have to travel to those meaning
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10538.wav|name yes because it's the first thought
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10539.wav|they can and this particular guy is a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10541.wav|himself is he bothered by this continued
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10542.wav|the correct number of batters from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10543.wav|CEO vince mcmahon doesn't mind them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10544.wav|those two wrestlers you need production
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10545.wav|asked some experts about that and it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10546.wav|how serious this virus was if it comes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10547.wav|that country has handled this pandemic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10548.wav|happen now we could have called it brawl
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10549.wav|just think about how astonishing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10550.wav|deserve neither sympathy nor
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10553.wav|donation made in their marble team's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10554.wav|still have some significant concerns
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10555.wav|like and first let me say that the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10556.wav|he's right the league should not ask
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10558.wav|just stage all events in Jacksonville or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10559.wav|second you start reading the details of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10560.wav|an Olympic rock climber using her home
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10563.wav|plus a marble tournament with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10564.wav|is no doubt that they have the ability
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10565.wav|that gap for a while you know until
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10567.wav|monster money so given that the absence
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10568.wav|heart-pounding events a passionate fan
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10569.wav|thousands of Americans every single week
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10570.wav|tale so as hard as it is to hear we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10571.wav|watch it and where to order my dumpling
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10572.wav|the MLB's new idea is to play an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10573.wav|the answer comes back yes if you like my
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10574.wav|be lying if we were to say we have a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10576.wav|coronavirus related causes and despite
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10577.wav|jaw-dropping inconceivable things this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10578.wav|as for broadcasters who are reliant on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10580.wav|okay but here's the thing we actually
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10581.wav|guy who doesn't mind on page college
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10582.wav|becomes much much more complicated
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10584.wav|Orioles squatting his dog who seems
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10585.wav|something uncomfortable to talk about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10586.wav|disease so everyone else can make

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10590.wav|can't rejoin his team until he has two
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10592.wav|well apparently that came from a Russian

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10595.wav|these to Philadelphia Stadium workers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10597.wav|basis and nobody to whom we have shown
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10598.wav|very different situation than we are in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10599.wav|League Baseball for instance was at one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10600.wav|as they can possibly be one employee

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10604.wav|isolating players you'd be doing that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10606.wav|professional sports and media production
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10607.wav|anyone to miss the birth of their first

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10612.wav|of risk and safety with some tact
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10613.wav|back too soon and irresponsibly it won't

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10616.wav|back the next year and they won it all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10617.wav|won't be the ones taking the risks and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10623.wav|athletes have no Union those in major
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10624.wav|you'd want is something that could fill
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10625.wav|hell out of them which intuitively seems
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10626.wav|league to actually come back this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10627.wav|literal stuffed elephant that you put in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10629.wav|are a horde of inhuman monsters who
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10630.wav|for the corona virus has taken its toll
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10631.wav|first child is simply unmissable and

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10648.wav|know who's medical advice is worth the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10649.wav|general public so the WWE has continued
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10650.wav|just missing the podium but did they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10652.wav|seclude the teams and you have them play
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10653.wav|used dog toy and it's not just mascots

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10657.wav|with large crowds packed together are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10658.wav|show and you're still complaining about

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10904.wav|should permanently change because of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10905.wav|would still have been impressive the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10907.wav|things like paid sick leave and hazard
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10908.wav|frankly no wonder many who can work feel
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10909.wav|one when it's already too late because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10910.wav|this country is going to need more than
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10911.wav|bars to qualify for example Amazon's

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10917.wav|like that man and that cat and our staff
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10918.wav|it's just the fact that out of context
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10920.wav|that risk is very very real grocery
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10921.wav|comfy shoes because we're about to go
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10923.wav|employee will tell you I worked at
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10925.wav|we might do too much the extension of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10926.wav|Trump tell it the rollout has been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10927.wav|underfunded for decades means that too
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10929.wav|somehow does it again and then again and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10930.wav|masterpieces just email John at John
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10931.wav|renown you're not alone we did look into
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10932.wav|is and on that note I actually have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10933.wav|because the u.s. is one of the few
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10935.wav|center is the overlap of tick tock
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10938.wav|unemployment insurance for the next few

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10944.wav|the Amazon smile logo is a quick sketch
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10945.wav|nothing now they're moving like hotcakes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10948.wav|remember I offered to buy $, for

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10950.wav|schmaltzy piano music maybe it's Amazon
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10951.wav|available anyway what we're talking
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10952.wav|a white void but it's actually just this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10953.wav|not to offer paid sick leave possibly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10954.wav|it is whether you're a small business
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10955.wav|it so you might want to lace up some
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10956.wav|protective gear and hand sanitizer
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10958.wav|with your health care or finances but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10959.wav|organize an employee walkout in Amazon's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10960.wav|impact on her experience at the bank -
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10962.wav|did it so what's the problem well there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10963.wav|time for that to be happening so it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10964.wav|workflow to allow for more distance or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10965.wav|with a dildo to completion in Deacons
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10966.wav|white void honestly I've been calling it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10970.wav|mass unemployment with the Paycheck
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10971.wav|twice as deadly for black and Latino
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10972.wav|that they have to even if that means
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10973.wav|of its own
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10975.wav|unemployment is incredibly difficult
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10977.wav|wouldn't want anyone with the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10978.wav|doing incredible dangerous work without
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10979.wav|learning a brand new skill and Tiger
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10980.wav|incarceration is tolerable as prisons
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10981.wav|has moderated his stance since then

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10983.wav|calling Oats hotline an actual number
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10984.wav|time holy with those results you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10985.wav|professionals to custodians to grocery
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10986.wav|been you get double pay and free health
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10987.wav|Congress absolutely needs to mandate all

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10992.wav|could have been preparing for this much
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10993.wav|heroes which is true what's also true is

../../input/johnoliver/wav/10996.wav|captain of the Titanic you just know
../../input/johnoliver/wav/10999.wav|will say they've now made their sick

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11006.wav|systems have been neglected and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11007.wav|have a perfect rollout but this is yet
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11008.wav|the risks to workers which can be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11009.wav|need to seriously think about whether
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11010.wav|is simply not going to cut it and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11011.wav|indefensible situations being thrown
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11012.wav|welfare state which is weird because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11013.wav|protection program experiencing a bumpy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11014.wav|health care and that workers need
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11015.wav|transit workers in New York City alone
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11016.wav|because I would argue it emphatically
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11017.wav|enduring a dangerous work environment

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11050.wav|are and we also shouldn't have leads a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11051.wav|situation the president just said was

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11061.wav|have become so popular a few weeks ago
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11062.wav|you now it's clearly been a very busy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11063.wav|right now and that's not even getting

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11070.wav|during quarantine the absolute dead
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11071.wav|isn't in fact while many of the problems
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11072.wav|people today the Democrats are just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11073.wav|they showcase the beauty of where larry
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11074.wav|ready to take loan applications because

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11081.wav|three shirts showcasing what I can only
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11082.wav|basically boils down to well if we help
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11084.wav|are a few issues there one Judy Kudlow
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11085.wav|try and brag about how in demand an

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11282.wav|pointed out in a beautiful essay you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11283.wav|people especially the elderly and the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11284.wav|so it is imperative that we spread cases

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11292.wav|you stop that buck Tony Tony probably
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11293.wav|that I would love it if his toothpaste
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11294.wav|president lies as much as the next guy

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11310.wav|of it is so obviously so please
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11311.wav|perfect I didn't do it I don't know

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11314.wav|World being closed or the th Fast &
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11315.wav|crucial right now the idea is to avoid

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11318.wav|the virus or know how quickly it is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11319.wav|not no we are not and incidentally if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11320.wav|this and I know he has specifically
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11321.wav|how calm knowledgeable and thorough
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11322.wav|be said about Trump who attempted to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11323.wav|drive through testing facilities which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11324.wav|reading from a prepared statement he
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11325.wav|okay it's okay I'm done
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11326.wav|defied every public health protocol by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11327.wav|you you get it for everybody else we all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11328.wav|in testing and said I don't take
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11329.wav|that's all you saw of the press
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11330.wav|about that both the place where we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11331.wav|to put in even the slightest bit of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11332.wav|range and it would be great if it did
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11333.wav|basically the time it takes to sing

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11335.wav|Europe could not get back into the

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11342.wav|enough ventilators for even the worst

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11345.wav|that website is about as effective as

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11347.wav|terms of containing the transmission of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11348.wav|lady I just work here that is a level of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11349.wav|for the time being neither will Trump's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11350.wav|misinformation because there is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11351.wav|might be feeling dizzy and you might be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11352.wav|contributing to a sense of confusion in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11353.wav|another substandard job after refusing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11354.wav|at feeding America org and just to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11355.wav|the case it seems we're gonna be a

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11358.wav|response and you should know he is the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11359.wav|then there is Geraldo Rivera who felt it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11360.wav|going forward we're gonna need to look
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11361.wav|perhaps best encapsulated by this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11362.wav|retweeting stuff that you do not know to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11363.wav|some sacrifice but this is a critical
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11364.wav|doesn't now personally I'm going to be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11365.wav|difficult choices about who gets
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11367.wav|of misinformation out there and not all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11368.wav|Thursday about our current testing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11369.wav|locations are no it won't do that but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11370.wav|characterized by disorganization and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11371.wav|crisis often with a particular focus on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11372.wav|that tick tock hamster is my favorite
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11373.wav|course he did nice work there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11374.wav|they're not important right now I mean
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11375.wav|our deserves to be a Premier League
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11376.wav|taping this we are clearly in the midst
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11377.wav|there is going to be ample time to be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11378.wav|hold on this is America I'm sure we have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11379.wav|distancing or as President Trump put it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11380.wav|reminiscent of Harry Truman's famous
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11381.wav|into a tissue your elbow or your upper
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11382.wav|thing in the world and it is truly sad
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11383.wav|performance because the moment the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11384.wav|spiraled from there America's major
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11385.wav|workers who are going to be in the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11386.wav|now keep holding it keep holding it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11387.wav|you are a caregiver as it is important
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11388.wav|tick tock hamsters always tick tock
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11389.wav|the only ones who've had to make big
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11391.wav|March Madness was canceled and as if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11392.wav|pass on misinformation in the coming
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11393.wav|beds and if cases spiked all at once
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11394.wav|that a hamster just genuinely offered
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11396.wav|it's out of my system now it just feels
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11398.wav|diseases dr. Anthony Fauci say this on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11399.wav|it's very difficult to say exactly where
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11401.wav|emblematic response was when he was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11402.wav|seconds on the clock right now during
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11403.wav|luxury so it is a good idea to treat
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11404.wav|of a man who has just completed yet
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11405.wav|flatten the curve it's a phrase you've
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11406.wav|who may be vulnerable or feeling
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11407.wav|disinfecting them well done keep holding
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11408.wav|that just means that the test is working
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11409.wav|important to point out that one of the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11410.wav|Geraldo keep holding your breath keep
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11411.wav|things stand
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11412.wav|spreading that is not only catastrophic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11413.wav|they were points ahead of Man City
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11414.wav|that he has been a rare source of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11415.wav|more delightful than this one it's going
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11416.wav|of each other and we will be back in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11417.wav|wear masks only if you have symptoms or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11419.wav|the thing I've waited my entire adult
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11422.wav|aversion to every single one of those
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11423.wav|didn't seem entirely satisfied with his
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11425.wav|actually just stupid enough now that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11426.wav|but why would you ask him why do you say
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11427.wav|second tick tock than the president has
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11428.wav|treatment which at present they won't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11430.wav|and that is just at the time that we are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11432.wav|times despite the fact he'd been exposed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11433.wav|ramped up their testing capabilities and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11434.wav|you're looking at is a cat or not see
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11435.wav|which and this is true it did not snow
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11436.wav|it's just cuz it's not like anyone's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11437.wav|isolated one small way you can help is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11438.wav|out of a longer period of time so that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11439.wav|the thing he makes a fine point but if I
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11440.wav|worried about getting this virus other
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11441.wav|like they should really give Liverpool
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11442.wav|about the things that they didn't want
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11443.wav|burning that just means you're
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11444.wav|weeks from sources like sadly the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11445.wav|Rudy no I would say that that feels too

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11523.wav|in fact you know what let's put
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11524.wav|you with a simple yes or no if the thing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11525.wav|even in our usual studio partly because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11526.wav|simply upload a photo and it will tell
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11528.wav|your breath I will tell you when to let

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11530.wav|scary and things are going to be weird
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11531.wav|over time so in terms of immediate help
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11532.wav|anything about it maybe someone in the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11533.wav|absolutely did not need to be there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11534.wav|but if you watch the whole event there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11535.wav|to trustworthy information from the CDC
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11536.wav|breathe her Aldo don't you breathe right
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11537.wav|inexplicably felt it important to bring
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11538.wav|sports are not important right now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11539.wav|going - is this a cat calm now if you're
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11540.wav|and no further explanation social
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11541.wav|tested positive for the corona virus
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11542.wav|and remember that this is also the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11543.wav|look this is clearly both frustrating
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11544.wav|the wind white whispers why the old
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11545.wav|to people with the virus himself last
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11546.wav|because our actual studio might be full
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11547.wav|so honestly in many ways what Rudy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11548.wav|virus we should also be doing everything
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11549.wav|really unnerving and is actively
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11550.wav|make in the coming days and weeks will
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11551.wav|his Rose Garden press conference on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11552.wav|most places to those who need them which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11554.wav|national emergency which is good and if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11555.wav|cases have so overwhelmed the system
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11556.wav|much not in Vietnam also it feels
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11557.wav|Trump seemed to be doing his very best
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11558.wav|currently taping this somewhere else
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11559.wav|breath just like this right you doing it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11560.wav|they were not that insurers would waive
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11561.wav|those with respiratory conditions and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11562.wav|with a very limited crew on this white
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11563.wav|that the website knows it's a cat now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11564.wav|which everyone can be selfishly angry
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11565.wav|stopped at the point is I don't know
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11567.wav|that we can to contain the spread of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11568.wav|crowded places cancel social engagements
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11570.wav|and it is amazing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11572.wav|one is part of what's called social
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11573.wav|little bit on our own here and because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11574.wav|yes proper social distancing involves
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11575.wav|spread of the virus so we don't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11578.wav|because we're having to fly blind in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11579.wav|frustrating especially when you see how
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11580.wav|deficit okay you're right
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11581.wav|it's the one John Cena was gonna be in I
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11584.wav|building had confirmed cases of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11585.wav|timeline in which the official White
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11586.wav|baby it is what it is but again nothing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11587.wav|the president's response has sadly been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11588.wav|mar-a-lago but perhaps the most
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11589.wav|you listening Geraldo ok and hold your
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11590.wav|keep thinking perspective but the very
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11591.wav|fact is even though this should not be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11592.wav|of coronavirus I'm actually serious
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11593.wav|time well spent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11594.wav|physical contact at all costs and if any
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11595.wav|so let's start the clock now cuz here's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11596.wav|of just how fast it all happened came as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11597.wav|office speech on Wednesday which was a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11599.wav|not familiar with this website you can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11600.wav|these things happen I don't know again
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11601.wav|because that would be Salvador Mansur
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11603.wav|that weren't enough Rita Wilson and her
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11605.wav|champion the coach Jurgen Klopp deserve
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11606.wav|they're not really important ever but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11607.wav|administration did it maybe Tony did it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11608.wav|for everyone but if you truly have no
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11609.wav|we've also learned political figures
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11610.wav|means that we can't yet properly track
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11611.wav|co-pays not just for testing but for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11612.wav|movie characters go when they've just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11614.wav|it the reason why social distancing is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11615.wav|true makes it even more important that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11616.wav|may just expand on that scream tweet a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11617.wav|of bedroom ice salvadore stop hit and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11618.wav|asked about the country's disastrous lag
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11619.wav|this virus are still not available in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11620.wav|cookie is so thick that's just nature
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11621.wav|some basic rules that health experts say
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11622.wav|about to pass out but don't worry g-man
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11623.wav|mean that stings I'm not gonna say it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11624.wav|website says no that's how you know it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11625.wav|president and instead pay more attention
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11626.wav|hashtag feminism announced that they had
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11627.wav|not true in any way whatsoever
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11628.wav|everyone who needs care can get it and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11629.wav|crisis gets and I know that this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11630.wav|effort she knows what I'm talking about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11631.wav|and touching the microphone at least
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11632.wav|instance of the word positive being
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11633.wav|economic impact that this is going to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11634.wav|the league title because they basically
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11635.wav|coronavirus this week so our staff has
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11636.wav|that is part of the reason why it was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11637.wav|there maybe Tony Tony you stop that buck
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11638.wav|marquee announcements in that press
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11640.wav|hamsters take care of yourself take care
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11641.wav|good job the same unfortunately cannot
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11642.wav|responsibility at all and then had this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11643.wav|Area and maybe expand it more broadly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11644.wav|happy birthday to Oprah twice so it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11645.wav|saying the buck stops somewhere over
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11646.wav|utterly furious with him later but the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11647.wav|a good website now will it tell you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11648.wav|they could max out our capacity and I
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11649.wav|NBA suspending its season or Disney
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11651.wav|positive which by the way is the rare
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11652.wav|likely months and the fact that that is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11653.wav|least times lower than this one and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11654.wav|shaking their hands patting their backs
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11655.wav|google quickly clarified the site is in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11658.wav|important to tell Fox viewers this well
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11659.wav|and illness with a mortality rate at
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11660.wav|always it's just what he does asking
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11662.wav|it out the point is I know that that may
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11663.wav|vulnerable among us and the healthcare
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11664.wav|horrific ly infectious and ruins
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11665.wav|the top US official on infectious
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11666.wav|weekend at mar-a-lago where a growing

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11668.wav|that Google was rapidly building a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11669.wav|help stem this outbreak individuals have

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11672.wav|some form sometime in the future and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11673.wav|just keep holding your breath do not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11674.wav|that's it that's it we're out of time
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11675.wav|football team Liverpool were literally
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11676.wav|commercial very much by the way the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11677.wav|disruption to your life is annoying and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11678.wav|out for one another and not just in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11681.wav|potentially life-saving treatment and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11682.wav|in multiple addresses to the nation and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11684.wav|be careful before forwarding or

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11688.wav|trip you had planned fell through but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11689.wav|frequently touch surfaces daily third
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11690.wav|by donating financially to your local
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11691.wav|these precautions like you would a flu
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11692.wav|weird isn't it this is definitely weird
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11693.wav|is fine here
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11694.wav|Trump why he says things are fine when
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11695.wav|we're doing a great job that is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11696.wav|choice but to go out it is vital to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11697.wav|the early stages of development with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11698.wav|very real threat and maybe the best sign
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11699.wav|count here and even if you are not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11700.wav|especially because despite from
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11701.wav|fact that he wrote something like that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11702.wav|conference he might have been reassured
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11703.wav|doctors have had to make a very
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11705.wav|keep as much distance as you can avoid
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11706.wav|here's the thing I hate it when the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11707.wav|attempting to to quell the spread of the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11708.wav|life for this they were about to win the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11710.wav|sports were suspended as was hockey
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11711.wav|seem obviously done but there was a ton
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11712.wav|they're obviously not it's like asking
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11713.wav|look I know things are currently very
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11714.wav|people basically for the time being
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11715.wav|of a rapidly escalating outbreak and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11716.wav|contribute directly to how bad this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11718.wav|holding your breath however I do have a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11719.wav|about this joke is landing so hard with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11720.wav|number of guests have since tested
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11721.wav|redwood tree grow so tall or why this

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11723.wav|dodging responsibility that Trump has
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11724.wav|look as you can clearly tell this is not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11725.wav|spending at the next seconds being
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11726.wav|irritated because you can't go out or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11729.wav|way that Geraldo contest for the corona
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11730.wav|when I uploaded a picture of a dog the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11731.wav|we should all absolutely be following to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11732.wav|unsettling a potentially lonely time so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11733.wav|for example of what it looks like when
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11735.wav|and then whenever we can and also partly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11736.wav|so important is because it can help us
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11737.wav|Furious movie being pushed back a year

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11745.wav|title for the first time in years
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11746.wav|fact he may have seen it declared a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11747.wav|furious about the fact that my favorite
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11749.wav|especially because for some reason Trump
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11750.wav|it always seems to from Rudy Gobert of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11751.wav|husband Tom
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11753.wav|disease expert no of course he isn't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11754.wav|exchange with a reporter you said that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11755.wav|shot you don't just get a flu shot for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11756.wav|lies and the all-time low so far came in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11757.wav|tick tock hamster is now my favorite
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11758.wav|probably heard a lot this week and what
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11759.wav|died or where they shot the karskids
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11760.wav|they're especially not important now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11761.wav|know that there is a temptation to think
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11762.wav|trophy gods of exactly dates okay okay
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11763.wav|speech was over this was his actual
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11764.wav|nation's leading infectious disease
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11766.wav|telling me could be for nothing most of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11767.wav|Gobert did was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11768.wav|thing that we should all do for the more
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11769.wav|distancing exclamation mark and here's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11770.wav|should look up that we should not worry
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11771.wav|where the drive-through testing

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11777.wav|finally stay home especially if you're
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11778.wav|up a series of CEOs whose companies were
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11779.wav|many people here in the u.s.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11780.wav|just makes me wanting to win the title
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11781.wav|managed to mistakenly claim that imports
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11782.wav|did that but you know it doesn't there's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11783.wav|transit try to do it at off-peak times
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11784.wav|your time looking at things that are and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11785.wav|to weather it this is got to be an

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11790.wav|and if bottles were sentient i would
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11791.wav|is heavily pushed the idea that if we as

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11793.wav|remove plants often have to stop
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11795.wav|and there are a number of reasons why

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11800.wav|and let's start with some history as

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11915.wav|the main thing coke is recycling is the

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11930.wav|my nose seems to be dying and it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11932.wav|more pointless than you assumed can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11933.wav|absolutely no interest in doing we have

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11942.wav|call that number now i dare you but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11944.wav|average american goes through roughly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11945.wav|clowns no one would ever mistake that

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11948.wav|public backlash
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11949.wav|strict limits on exports of plastic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11950.wav|are illegally incinerating lots of

../../input/johnoliver/wav/11953.wav|wish cycling sounds like a spin class
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11954.wav|beetlejuice and saying totes mcgoats
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11955.wav|there is it's up to you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11956.wav|yeah there's ketchup packets in there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11957.wav|of all plastic winds up in a so-called
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11958.wav|and the thing is when plastic isn't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11959.wav|it's not really recyclable and that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11960.wav|exactly slurp
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11961.wav|inserted themselves into a native
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11962.wav|just too good to be wasted on garbage
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11963.wav|and the reason that we know that is even
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11965.wav|bicycle helmets and it's in this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11968.wav|it becomes the thing that originally was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11969.wav|vast majority ending up in landfills or
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11972.wav|weird scary not funny and they eat
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11974.wav|now you might have seen that ad before
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11975.wav|as the number one top global polluter
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11976.wav|winds up getting recycled than you might
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11978.wav|so the false impression that we've all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11980.wav|waste collected at cleanups have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11981.wav|but it can be hard on an individual
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11984.wav|that an average person globally could be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11985.wav|has been to make a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11986.wav|recycle those otherwise remember you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11987.wav|since plastic's introduction production
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11991.wav|that recycling is pointless but it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11993.wav|recycling plastic while it might be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11995.wav|ever be made viable on an economic basis
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11996.wav|so i guess katy perry's question do you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11997.wav|response to all the damage you've seen
../../input/johnoliver/wav/11998.wav|show i know you will slurp
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12000.wav|recyclable because we so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12001.wav|few misleading things about it first
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12004.wav|although we should absolutely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12007.wav|soon because this problem is only
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12009.wav|everything else in the same way that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12010.wav|us isn't recycled because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12011.wav|of their plastic from recycled material
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12012.wav|is just no way that the people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12013.wav|so anxious to make
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12014.wav|whether they could actually be recycled
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12015.wav|routinely buy at the supermarket
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12016.wav|that states
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12018.wav|for decades over the years they've
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12019.wav|but more importantly our personal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12020.wav|and there is a way to do this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12021.wav|companies who wanted to drill home the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12023.wav|among other things force companies to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12024.wav|muncie indiana's mr blue who appears to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12025.wav|comes to this that is how bad things are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12028.wav|years now and look on a personal level
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12030.wav|and we have produced a lot of plastic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12032.wav|manufacturers and companies like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12033.wav|plastic into their system
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12034.wav|that they can handle and at worst they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12035.wav|division have gone out of their way
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12037.wav|and composed of leading beverage and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12040.wav|. cashback a few thousand free airline
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12041.wav|if you're wealthy enough
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12042.wav|that includes the red slapper
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12043.wav|and two plastics things like soda and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12044.wav|sometimes there is no market
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12046.wav|comes together of course not the guy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12048.wav|do get recycled although depending on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12049.wav|oh it's fine calm down it's magic stop
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12051.wav|tried to answer from the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12053.wav|and just listen to this community
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12054.wav|suggesting there is complete
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12055.wav|old people would play chess while
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12056.wav|asphyxiated sausage to my absolute
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12057.wav|you'll notice that it's now six years
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12058.wav|and the problem is those countries don't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12059.wav|are pretty important because they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12060.wav|wish cycle things like umbrellas because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12062.wav|usable materials and as a good rule
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12063.wav|nothing significant is going to happen
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12065.wav|definitely don't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12066.wav|either create the infrastructure and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12067.wav|nowhere but it will soon be introduced
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12068.wav|non-recyclable items can be a hassle to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12069.wav|but i will say at least they're being
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12070.wav|the other side of the world
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12072.wav|world didn't really worry about this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12073.wav|well that sounds amazing unfortunately
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12075.wav|they do put in the work you think a look
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12078.wav|because of course it is but on the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12079.wav|all of their containers regardless of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12080.wav|there is serious doubt that recycling
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12081.wav|our main story tonight concerns plastic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12082.wav|through a portland supermarket
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12085.wav|some spot on casting right there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12086.wav|in other words a bottle
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12088.wav|garbage patch of microplastic waste in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12089.wav|for almost as long as plastics have been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12090.wav|well hang on who said anything about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12091.wav|miles and a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12092.wav|future generations let's at least
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12094.wav|taught by a unicorn or the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12095.wav|for all those mascots to recycle
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12096.wav|to an immersion blender you lost a year
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12097.wav|really good the problem is coke has been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12098.wav|and the numbers inside them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12099.wav|ideally you'd want to balance a little
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12104.wav|where a bottle goes on a long
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12106.wav|there is a non-zero chance that you can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12110.wav|trash and separating

../../input/johnoliver/wav/12125.wav|capital one's new slogan
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12126.wav|salmon and of course the blobfish the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12127.wav|most recycled plastic gets down cycled

../../input/johnoliver/wav/12129.wav|like in this ad from. nature
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12131.wav|because it can seem
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12132.wav|number on it and no indication who it

../../input/johnoliver/wav/12135.wav|start again should really be

../../input/johnoliver/wav/12254.wav|which is a bit weird i guess those
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12255.wav|most plastics
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12256.wav|that's terrible and i have to say there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12257.wav|convince us that all their waste is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12258.wav|but the thing is despite knowing that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12261.wav|several states are currently considering
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12262.wav|of course you're called slurp that is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12263.wav|recycled is so strong
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12264.wav|now the good news is more than
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12265.wav|level to end their use a better move
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12266.wav|hype about recycling a lot less plastic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12268.wav|odd until
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12269.wav|are commonly recyclable certain types of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12270.wav|yeah that is shocking because think of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12271.wav|it's true a recent study even estimated
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12272.wav|i've already somehow lost so far this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12274.wav|certain plastics don't get recycled some
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12275.wav|is not the main culprit here despite
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12276.wav|making and breaking promises like that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12277.wav|is only about two percent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12278.wav|that unbreakable chain of heartthrobs
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12279.wav|and isn't going anywhere for the next
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12280.wav|it's very much the jane lynch of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12281.wav|been given that all the plastics
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12282.wav|plastic waste we couldn't use in bulk
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12285.wav|materials and that is incredibly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12286.wav|oh that smells great is someone baking
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12287.wav|thoughtful targeted bands that force the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12288.wav|responsible for burning that waste

../../input/johnoliver/wav/12309.wav|deal with their own plastic waste
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12311.wav|plastic production is expected to triple
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12314.wav|it's not now first off he's right the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12315.wav|this one for game boy in the s that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12316.wav|plastic production began to grow in the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12317.wav|ivory it doesn't bear thinking about but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12318.wav|no one named a holiday after him but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12319.wav|create laws that essentially
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12320.wav|shitload of plastic so how is it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12321.wav|what that executive board ken doll is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12322.wav|message that it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12323.wav|than five percent of it

../../input/johnoliver/wav/12329.wav|has skyrocketed to million tons
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12330.wav|items it's actually not that simple as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12331.wav|in. in fact half of all plastics
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12332.wav|or force them to stop making them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12333.wav|like this one in malaysia
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12334.wav|or takeout containers reducing that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12339.wav|countries agreed last year to place

../../input/johnoliver/wav/12344.wav|seems to be the exact mask that that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12345.wav|dream was i wish
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12346.wav|what the plastics industry has spent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12347.wav|pixar movie and he'd absolutely nail it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12350.wav|that we might have taken from mascots
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12351.wav|to invest in curbside recycling programs

../../input/johnoliver/wav/12353.wav|more than million tons end up in our

../../input/johnoliver/wav/12372.wav|this fresh just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12373.wav|we could make our plastic problem go
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12374.wav|can have serious consequences
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12375.wav|blissful decades america and most of the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12376.wav|plastics could be put into continuous
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12377.wav|we should absolutely keep recycling
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12378.wav|more plastics than fish that is all fish
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12379.wav|the kid loved bags so what can we

../../input/johnoliver/wav/12381.wav|that one draw in your kitchen is a

../../input/johnoliver/wav/12385.wav|litter on the freeway but there are a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12386.wav|because apparently the worst thing white
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12387.wav|we have the capacity to recycle less
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12388.wav|recycled meaning percent

../../input/johnoliver/wav/12414.wav|taking my brain down with it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12415.wav|big show of tiny improvements and then
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12416.wav|loads of plastics that could otherwise

../../input/johnoliver/wav/12421.wav|and frustratingly the plastic industry's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12422.wav|than france germany and spain combined
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12423.wav|no leave this place no
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12424.wav|why so little plastic gets recycled the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12425.wav|without a national epr law addressing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12426.wav|strap-on thigh dildo just imagine a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12427.wav|be outnumbered by plastic in the ocean
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12428.wav|important to know that it's not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12429.wav|and how the plastics industry has
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12430.wav|what i don't care you need to get out of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12432.wav|thing for a clown i know we've been

../../input/johnoliver/wav/12436.wav|and by the ocean is expected to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12437.wav|may not and when it comes to plastics
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12438.wav|and secondly the term wish cycling is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12439.wav|but he doesn't he beats up the dance
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12440.wav|get out of here the fact is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12442.wav|guess at least this time
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12443.wav|i know this can feel demoralizing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12445.wav|honest there that the bottle became a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12446.wav|do you ever feel like a plastic warm-up
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12448.wav|american ad is still around
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12449.wav|united states
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12453.wav|let alone millions of tons of ours which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12456.wav|crucially very few of those seven types
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12457.wav|around there's been a question of what
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12458.wav|we'll see you all april th good night
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12459.wav|this is a covey compliance set you can't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12460.wav|eight years after that aired
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12462.wav|generated are recycled in the united
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12465.wav|obstacles that the plastic is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12467.wav|rubber goat mask cheap and by the first
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12468.wav|the people behind that fake native
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12469.wav|markets to recycle the products they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12470.wav|decades and millions of dollars trying
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12471.wav|not if the ferret knows what it's doing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12472.wav|and it is obvious that meaningful change
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12473.wav|in they announced plans to source
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12475.wav|can end up contaminating
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12477.wav|to become a carpet
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12479.wav|so did plastic waste and therefore
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12481.wav|like those lettuce tubs you saw earlier
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12482.wav|it's by no means the first time someone
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12483.wav|hard-on for plastic bags not seen since
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12485.wav|isn't that right blobfish oh absolutely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12486.wav|types of plastic they accept and then
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12488.wav|contaminated or difficult to sort
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12489.wav|are really much good
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12492.wav|to walk into polling places
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12493.wav|Because mail-in ballots in particular
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12494.wav|There is still one more potential wrinkle
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12496.wav|and you live in a state where you can vote early,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12497.wav|because remember, with fewer polling places open this year,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12498.wav|nine ballots. And when his bosses realized
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12499.wav|Either from when you registered to vote,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12500.wav|Just imagine buying the wrong K-cups for the breakroom,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12501.wav|or even years later," but here's the thing,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12503.wav|And finally, as for those thousand extra ballots
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12504.wav|For starts, the president has repeatedly instructed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12506.wav|The real one, and your coffee shop signature.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12507.wav|it helps to understand one key statistic...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12508.wav|to a single voting nexus, even while some of them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12510.wav|to claim that all manner of ballot fraud
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12511.wav|and the importance of down-ballot races.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12512.wav|which is obviously nerve-racking.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12513.wav|Yeah. The truth is,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12515.wav|And replicating your own signature,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12516.wav|later clarified that they actually...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12517.wav|what are you gonna do? Calligraph the iPad?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12518.wav|and suddenly turn into a good loser,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12519.wav|to try and discredit voting by mail,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12520.wav|until just now.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12521.wav|Exactly.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12522.wav|From individual voters, to TV networks
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12524.wav|is one of the last things you want to hear
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12528.wav|Really? Aww, come on, stranger things have happened.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12529.wav|the system is designed to prevent people voting twice.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12531.wav|Well, luckily there are steps you can take.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12532.wav|unless you want some local news reporter to show up
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12533.wav|While the majority of Biden supporters
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12534.wav|as election night, and more as an election month,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12535.wav|Deep down, you know there is no scenario in which Trump loses
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12538.wav|there is any danger with them,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12539.wav|to let you know if your ballot was disqualified,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12541.wav|could be dangerously infectious."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12542.wav|from someone giving you a tattoo.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12543.wav|They hit prosecutors, cash bail, sheriffs,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12544.wav|but decides the process was legit and then shows up
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12545.wav|Okay, I know that sounds like a lot,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12547.wav|which is a lot like when someone says
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12550.wav|considering that the literal definition
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12551.wav|we're taping this show on Saturday,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12552.wav|to put inside a decoration envelope, which you do.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12553.wav|The Oscars, there are a shit ton of envelopes to open,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12554.wav|And the concern is, that in that early stage,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12555.wav|We're in that "very dark place" already,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12556.wav|I've talked about so far turns out to be a problem.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12557.wav|where grisly murders took place?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12558.wav|Latino and Black voters who already face
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12560.wav|Because if there's one thing Republicans have done
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12562.wav|the Democrats sued and the RNC entered
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12563.wav|his girlfriend's parents for the first time,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12564.wav|and start playing fucking ballot Batman.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12565.wav|And even though Trump is currently in the hospital
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12566.wav|but it actually refers to the idea that since
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12568.wav|makes every decent American want to vomit.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12569.wav|to stay at home and many polling sites may be closed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12570.wav|the lines aren't too long,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12571.wav|And just spare a quick thought for that temp there.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12572.wav|your ballot rejected for technical reasons.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12574.wav|although, I will say, "Sometimes I write it beautiful,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12576.wav|So it might actually help to stop thinking of it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12577.wav|at the ways they've tried to do that,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12578.wav|where, people cast ballots,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12579.wav|at a polling site is never a great look,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12580.wav|and claim any additional ballots are fraudulent.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12581.wav|which has just residents, or Harris County
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12582.wav|which has more than four million.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12583.wav|No again? Okay, sorry Quibi,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12585.wav|Yeah, but you're the one undermining our confidence.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12586.wav|Okay, that is unfortunate to find out,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12588.wav|that just infected the president,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12589.wav|on democratic votes. And to understand why,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12591.wav|you're completely right, I can't argue with that.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12594.wav|in this year's primaries.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12596.wav|the Trump campaign could declare victory
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12598.wav|Yeah, of course it does!
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12599.wav|And it's also surprisingly important
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12600.wav|As for the "wastepaper basket" example,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12601.wav|of every single awards show.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12602.wav|and extremely dumb. So the fact is,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12603.wav|don't show up to harass voters, there are plenty of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12605.wav|And look, given the frequency with which one party has been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12607.wav|during Tuesday's debate.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12608.wav|First, as an individual, make a plan to vote.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12609.wav|Although, I'm not sure you can really keep calling it a moral majority
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12610.wav|your vote didn't count and throw your skills
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12612.wav|Oh, and also, do be careful with your signature
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12614.wav|the majority of voters.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12615.wav|a deliberate campaign to undermine the process.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12616.wav|Meanwhile in Texas, their governor has insisted
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12617.wav|You know what? You're absolutely right,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12618.wav|screaming about how the radical left
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12619.wav|a couple of loop de loops. Look, you're getting a muffin,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12620.wav|be able to put their thumb on the scale of this election.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12621.wav|, is a shit ton of envelopes,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12622.wav|on the night of the election, not days, months,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12623.wav|can be more difficult than you might expect.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12626.wav|for three days, mistakenly discarded
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12627.wav|People whose role is to monitor elections so everyone is treated fairly.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12629.wav|you should do that especially to make the line
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12630.wav|election officials for holding an early voting event
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12632.wav|The majority...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12633.wav|and the looming threat of the pandemic,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12634.wav|And the second most famous part is it spitting itself out again.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12635.wav|Moving on. Our main story tonight concerns the election,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12636.wav|More than three million votes have already been cast,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12637.wav|And when you take all of this together,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12639.wav|And by the way, if you are still worried
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12640.wav|as a tattoo artist into significant doubt.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12641.wav|were rejected in the primaries. That's practically
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12642.wav|Which, by the way should probably be the official tagline
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12643.wav|summarizing Get Out when you've only seen the beginning.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12645.wav|Trump himself has gone out of his way
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12646.wav|They've done it for years.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12648.wav|when the philosophy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12649.wav|so everything's cool.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12650.wav|Because he is wildly misrepresenting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12651.wav|can take a long time to count.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12652.wav|where some voters in Fairfax County, Virginia,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12654.wav|Some states have secrecy envelopes,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12656.wav|that was a -course tasting menu of horseshit.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12657.wav|in this election, and it happens after you voted.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12659.wav|Which sounds bad, but the key thing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12661.wav|if you've noticed but everything
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12662.wav|and aggressive purchase of voter rolls.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12663.wav|In, the year after Weyrich spoke, the RNC formed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12664.wav|to just one per county, whether it's Loving County
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12665.wav|And sometimes they change over the course
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12668.wav|are on top of theirs as well.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12669.wav|is covered in smoke, there's a global pandemic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12670.wav|But, you should know, the trays were full
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12671.wav|to think about the signature that you're using.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12674.wav|to take the pressure off the system.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12676.wav|Yeah, that is how it starts, but maybe
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12677.wav|Yeah, if this election is close, we may not know for a while.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12679.wav|And this year, the discrepancy in how people vote
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12680.wav|Yeah! He has to see, and by that, of course,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12682.wav|that you read the instructions carefully.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12683.wav|it may take significantly longer to get the final results
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12684.wav|You can find information for your state
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12685.wav|that was an instance where a temp worker
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12686.wav|until Election Day itself.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12687.wav|Still no? How about if you could watch
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12688.wav|have been wildly overblown. And to the extent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12689.wav|And that's that you could end up having
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12690.wav|to correct them. But none of those examples
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12692.wav|Sometimes with a veneer of fighting voter fraud
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12693.wav|of any scheme to steal votes.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12694.wav|have lit up rightwing media, appear to be part
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12695.wav|It's a semi-arid sandbox filled with fluffy cows
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12696.wav|and opening them is gonna take a long fucking time.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12697.wav|other reasons in person voting could be tricky this year.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12699.wav|maybe one of your shows will be a hit.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12700.wav|that they have on record for you.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12701.wav|Think about that. Over half a million ballots
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12702.wav|So we all need to be on top of not only our own voting plans,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12703.wav|at canivote.org.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12704.wav|within driving distance of Disneyland
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12705.wav|And if they are, the scheme seems to be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12706.wav|he mentioned, that was a fuck up
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12707.wav|among other things, the inspiration
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12708.wav|But luckily, her parents seem like a couple of real sweeties,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12709.wav|and tactics like strict voter ID laws
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12710.wav|He seems to be referring to reports
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12711.wav|while also providing a much better
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12712.wav|the country to a dark place, I don't know
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12714.wav|Everyone behaves themselves at polling places,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12715.wav|is decaffeinating the suburbs.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12716.wav|The Heritage Foundation and The Moral Majority.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12718.wav|who'd only worked at the county election office
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12719.wav|so it's gonna take a long fucking time.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12720.wav|but as you've probably already guessed,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12721.wav|"get out the vote" message than anyone currently working
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12722.wav|that Trump cited, all of which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12723.wav|it's frankly no wonder that around percent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12724.wav|could lead to a so-called blue shift,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12725.wav|that are accustomed to going all out
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12726.wav|were sent two mail-in ballots by mistake.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12727.wav|But that has actually opened up
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12728.wav|Because they match them against the one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12729.wav|was less than minutes at a time with commercials?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12731.wav|and even more importantly how we can help prevent that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12734.wav|all those votes invalidated.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12735.wav|armed off-duty policemen to patrol largely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12736.wav|turbocharging efforts to mess with the vote.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12738.wav|which you don't sign. Which you then have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12739.wav|You know, like the one about flipping houses
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12740.wav|two years from now and tell you that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12741.wav|about mailing your ballot in, it is worth knowing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12742.wav|and those will get counted faster
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12744.wav|It's not your art finger, it's for pointing.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12747.wav|of Americans say they'll be voting by mail this year.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12748.wav|and you should absolutely use that resource if you can.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12749.wav|is the state trying to swallow itself up.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12751.wav|Oh, it's about a young man who meets
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12752.wav|Now, that man is Paul Weyrich,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12753.wav|Can you imagine watching five hours
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12754.wav|as soon as you filled it in.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12755.wav|calling the legitimacy of our democracy into question.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12756.wav|Now, if you wanna vote by mail, that's great too.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12757.wav|our signatures change over time.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12758.wav|Many votes are counted after election night.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12760.wav|The really important thing to remember is,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12761.wav|That is just not going to happen.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12764.wav|We do need to talk about this election
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12766.wav|because there is a natural vulnerability here
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12767.wav|And this is going to take
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12768.wav|And it's not like we haven't had problems with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12769.wav|into a consent decree, pledging to stop such behavior
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12770.wav|suggesting they might seek to have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12771.wav|What can we do to help the system run smoother?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12772.wav|and selling election night as an event,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12773.wav|and expect the system to just magically work itself out,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12776.wav|but they did it in less time and more entertainingly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12778.wav|because if he doesn't he'll refuse to accept the results.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12780.wav|And as for the notion that this could take
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12782.wav|Despite the fact, as studies and court cases
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12783.wav|that the Trump campaign may be able to exploit
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12784.wav|that nobody wants.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12786.wav|Unfortunately, a judge lifted that consent decree in.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12788.wav|are matched to individual voters,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12789.wav|We thought tonight it might be a good idea to take a look
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12790.wav|like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12791.wav|that drop off locations for absentee ballots be limited
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12792.wav|that fears over mail-in ballot fraud
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12793.wav|this election is already very different
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12794.wav|and armbands who threatens the safety of the polls.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12797.wav|at work, ended up being held up
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12798.wav|So, they are a lot of places where Republicans might
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12800.wav|Yeah. That's not good because he's not describing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12802.wav|which can cause real problems especially for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12804.wav|That is really bad. Unless of course
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12805.wav|You're doing it right there.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12806.wav|That slogan honestly never made sense to me
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12808.wav|And the thing is, even if Trump supporters
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12809.wav|And to be fair to voters, ballots can be tricky.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12810.wav|Of course not, it's your pointer finger.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12811.wav|Thanks to the pandemic, many poll workers are choosing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12813.wav|to Biden's house with a congratulatory ice cream cake.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12814.wav|a founding father of modern conservatives
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12815.wav|we all have at least two signatures.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12818.wav|But sometimes, they've just said it out loud.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12819.wav|to social media networks that could become
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12820.wav|a whole new front in republican's war
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12822.wav|if we're not extremely careful. Remember, he may receive
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12823.wav|And look, mistakes are going to happen
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12824.wav|Which does make sense, it's a logistical nightmare.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12829.wav|cesspools of misinformation.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12830.wav|then pull ahead once all the mail ballots are counted.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12831.wav|So it's clearly very much in Trump's interest
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12832.wav|to understand there is that because ballots
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12833.wav|And this brings us to our final point.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12834.wav|In Wisconsin, Republican legislators threatened to sue
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12835.wav|whenever you're watching this.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12836.wav|And making it worse, in some key battleground states
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12838.wav|and sometimes I just sign it quick,"
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12839.wav|from all those before it.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12840.wav|it's actually a far more mundane one.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12841.wav|official poll watchers there.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12842.wav|be sure it was received and counted,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12844.wav|say they'll vote by-mail.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12845.wav|Although, we don't want everyone doing that,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12846.wav|a fake National Ballot Security Task Force and hired
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12847.wav|with coronavirus and everything is up in the air right now,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12848.wav|than it has in the past.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12849.wav|And when they do, we should move fast
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12850.wav|Just watch one California man
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12851.wav|every single one of those cases.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12852.wav|which I know sounds like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12853.wav|has joined in, saying shit like this.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12856.wav|Because watch this Georgia voter show you how long his line was.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12857.wav|substantially longer wait times than white voters.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12859.wav|As this handwriting expert explains.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12860.wav|He himself has tweeted that we "Must know election results
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12862.wav|what he'd done, they immediately reported it...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12863.wav|in Republicans attempting to depress turnouts.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12866.wav|in an election with over million ballots.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12867.wav|in the future which is great.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12868.wav|over the last few years is regain the nation's trust.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12869.wav|for Joe Biden. I have no notes.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12871.wav|while standing in line to vote?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12872.wav|to reset our expectations.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12874.wav|And first, let's acknowledge there's nothing new
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12876.wav|And in theory, some states are supposed
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12877.wav|of a single day. 'Cause let's be honest here,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12878.wav|that could lead to a Run the Jewels listening party
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12880.wav|it really might be for the best.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12881.wav|more Biden supporters are voting by mail,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12882.wav|Sunday, / Central on ABC.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12883.wav|an adjustment on everybody's part.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12884.wav|because it's happening right now.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12886.wav|For months now, Trump has been questioning whether
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12887.wav|He's essentially giving his supporters the greenlight
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12889.wav|You may have two ballots, but you can only cast one.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12890.wav|-and they charge .-- -MAN Bad idea!
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12891.wav|"Don't mess with Texas, unless you're directing them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12892.wav|as evidence of a leftwing conspiracy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12893.wav|learn that it happened to him in.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12894.wav|And it's getting hard for the rest of us to watch.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12895.wav|so who knows what things are like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12896.wav|of a few absentee ballots in Wisconsin
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12897.wav|have repeatedly shown, it isn't.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12898.wav|That is why election officials are so anxious
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12899.wav|All subjects we've talked about on this show,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12900.wav|but making sure our friends and family
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12901.wav|Although that does track with Texas's famous slogan,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12902.wav|read all the instructions,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12904.wav|and you're on television in stupid Woody Allen glasses,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12907.wav|That incident caused such an outcry
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12908.wav|states have some sort of ballot tracking so you can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12909.wav|the show vertically or horizontally?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12912.wav|and nobody fucks up their mail-in ballots.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12913.wav|You can't? Well what if each video
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12914.wav|They shouldn't, but they will.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12915.wav|Yep, I hate to break this to you two billion dollars in,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12916.wav|is already taking place. He even rattled off examples
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12917.wav|If you want to do it in person, on Election Day, that's great.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12918.wav|'Cause imagine if some stupid mistake you made
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12920.wav|his supporters to go to polling places
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12921.wav|"You know, I'm more of a hands-free artist."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12922.wav|it's the actual Wyoming disappearing, in which case,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12924.wav|Black and Hispanic precincts in New Jersey,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12926.wav|trying to destabilize this election.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12927.wav|it's their birthday month, in that the very concept
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12928.wav|and next thing you know, Tucker Carlson is on TV,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12931.wav|a larger proportion of in-person votes,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12932.wav|and send it back or drop it off
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12933.wav|aggressive poll watching in the past.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12935.wav|And in an election with so many mail-in votes,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12938.wav|with the task force's name.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12939.wav|And the swing could be even more pronounced.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12940.wav|So, request your ballot as early as possible,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12941.wav|After all, HBO Max still exists,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12942.wav|Because, I have to say, if you plan is to just sit back
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12943.wav|shorter on Election Day, for those who don't have that luxury.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12945.wav|horribly coordinated, totally nonsensical,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12946.wav|And just as a general rule, revolvers and armbands
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12947.wav|First, on the "ballots in the creek" example.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12948.wav|Which brings us to something very important,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12950.wav|but you know what, who knows,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12951.wav|you should stop talking until you know the whole story.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12952.wav|or the one you have on file at the DMV.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12953.wav|of all sorts of mail, and state election officials
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12954.wav|being found in trays of mail that were found in a ditch.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12955.wav|I guess it's official, you're a bad idea.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12958.wav|Which is usually just a line and depending on your mood
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12960.wav|and yet Trump and his supporters have engaged in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12961.wav|but in practice, that doesn't always happen.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12962.wav|and the co-founder of right-wing groups like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12964.wav|for the single best voting PSA the world has ever seen.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12965.wav|But we should be trying to flatten the voting curve
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12966.wav|It's clear that even you don't like you, Wyoming.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12968.wav|claiming it's rife with fraud.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12970.wav|you should know it's already started.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12971.wav|of streaming video on your phone,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12972.wav|the long lines, the possibility of harassment,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12973.wav|where they prominently displayed revolvers and armbands
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12974.wav|and nothing. The most famous part of Wyoming
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12975.wav|of one of your founders is immorally suppress
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12978.wav|It can be confusing, so do make sure
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12979.wav|We've already seen the impact of fewer polling places
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12980.wav|and that this man will have a three-quarter life crisis
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12981.wav|Projecting winners on election night can be a bit like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12983.wav|And if you think any of this is me being paranoid,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12984.wav|an entire Wyoming disappearing into thin air.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12985.wav|he means he has to see if he wins
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12987.wav|and monitor for instance of fraud.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12988.wav|But look, let's say that none of what
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12989.wav|So, if your schedule is flexible enough,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12991.wav|they're not even allowed to begin processing mail-in ballots
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12992.wav|of an actual Nazi is someone with guns
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12993.wav|Even Bill Barr, his attorney general
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12994.wav|But the fact is that this year, the Trump campaign is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12995.wav|a euphemism for a Smurf's bowel movement,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12996.wav|And it's not just Trump claiming they're illegitimate.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/12997.wav|we don't need to know on the night at all.

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13074.wav|what i do know is that he was an avid
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13075.wav|came on monday night when the rnc chose
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13077.wav|and that alone should actually be pretty
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13079.wav|action and they did this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13081.wav|were talking to was pretty clear even in

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13085.wav|concerns the week that we've just had

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13088.wav|and honestly i wish i were but the fact
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13089.wav|looks like i've got a bidding war on my
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13091.wav|imply that maybe it was a reason they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13092.wav|very fine people which he did
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13093.wav|to the extent that real change is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13094.wav|it's a peaceful story of unity and hope

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13118.wav|by nba coach doc rivers in an emotional
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13119.wav|speak the night before he chose to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13120.wav|nba had a jersey ready made for them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13121.wav|has defended those who proudly fly the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13122.wav|small moments like this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13124.wav|i think the answer to that is pretty

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13138.wav|the militias saying and i quote
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13140.wav|because it seems like you're making a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13141.wav|that they were about to refuse to play

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13145.wav|only appropriate action is peaceful and

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13147.wav|all the way down the ballot from the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13148.wav|of objective reality for one thing there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13149.wav|although it also brings us to the fact
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13150.wav|way past their government post bedtime
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13151.wav|i'm honestly surprised a speaker didn't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13152.wav|law-abiding citizens it was a disconnect
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13154.wav|depressing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13155.wav|and the rnc this week actually ended up
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13156.wav|defend property he didn't own
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13158.wav|starting to fly around
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13159.wav|way that i am history's greatest

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13168.wav|our african-american neighbors and that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13169.wav|immediately after
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13170.wav|precisely three things property damage
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13171.wav|us to the second part of our story this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13172.wav|combined with the pressure to perform at
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13174.wav|especially infuriating that they took
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13175.wav|ugliest forces in american society
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13177.wav|viewer of tucker carlson a show that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13178.wav|been delivering essentially the same

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13182.wav|until it is forced to so it's easy for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13183.wav|this has been one hell of a week so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13186.wav|none of those things biden is a radical
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13187.wav|whatever remains can be easily overcome
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13188.wav|violence and criminals are coming to

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13193.wav|is himself the definition of disorder
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13195.wav|was pretty clear it seems as if the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13196.wav|really be surprising coming from mike
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13197.wav|that lionizes threats of violence
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13198.wav|shoot out of my hands
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13199.wav|bit but let's start with the rnc
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13200.wav|back by police
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13201.wav|to sheriffs and even that will be very
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13202.wav|okay if that is what most people in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13203.wav|joe biden will be an agent of radical
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13204.wav|removal of the confederate flag was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13207.wav|but the nba players now have a promise
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13210.wav|of the differences between being black

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13214.wav|politically s germany

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13217.wav|protect you as a black athlete
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13218.wav|from having his leg broken by nypd
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13219.wav|in the same week where the rnc was

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13221.wav|bringing energy to the rnc that can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13222.wav|and there might actually be no more
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13223.wav|with three of his children in the car
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13225.wav|built to be non-responsive
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13226.wav|they're not taking a night off from work
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13227.wav|so haley turning what happened in south
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13228.wav|an event to celebrate the stewardship of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13229.wav|at one point claim that trump invented
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13230.wav|kenosha sheriff who
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13231.wav|lives matter movement also refused to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13232.wav|the emotional toll of being black in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13233.wav|think of it like the moon in that it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13236.wav|everything but much more importantly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13239.wav|feel or say this has to be about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13240.wav|in the right tax bracket to have their
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13241.wav|stopped from having small children
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13242.wav|we're going to see going forward
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13243.wav|of lies some
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13244.wav|we appreciate you guys we really do and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13245.wav|a white supremacist killed nine people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13247.wav|killed two people and look
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13249.wav|is that it's far too easy to co-opt
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13251.wav|really only be described as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13253.wav|nor should it be because people are sick
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13254.wav|don't say that was a close one while the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13255.wav|but to underscore just how limiting that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13257.wav|sure nikki i guess that's technically
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13260.wav|because again and again rnc speakers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13262.wav|out some pretty important parts
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13264.wav|even sitting front row at a rally back
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13265.wav|started to happen in his sport
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13267.wav|maybe forcing exactly who sits down and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13268.wav|environmentalist
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13269.wav|and have continued marching even as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13270.wav|agreed-upon options
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13271.wav|comes together to help redecorate a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13274.wav|the events in kenosha would be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13275.wav|what happened in kenosha wisconsin where
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13276.wav|because if it showed us one thing this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13277.wav|our african-american neighbors who i
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13278.wav|warehouses
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13279.wav|occupied by one very lonely malnourished
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13282.wav|because a year old vigilante with a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13283.wav|striking and in doing so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13284.wav|of people marched in the wake of george
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13285.wav|and all of this overt talk of racial
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13286.wav|but maybe the biggest gulf between the r
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13288.wav|although in a week of incredible
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13289.wav|sheriff and not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13290.wav|while simultaneously fear-mongering
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13291.wav|they're not exactly taking a spa day and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13292.wav|the system does not respond
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13293.wav|view it encompasses
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13295.wav|is the only thing that's going to bring
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13296.wav|okay then that's kimberly guilfoyle
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13298.wav|by an administration that encourages the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13300.wav|at gunpoint last month and the message
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13301.wav|although i will point out to you that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13302.wav|at the best of times but something that

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13340.wav|tonight we're going to talk about two

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13355.wav|players felt they had to escalate their

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13358.wav|flag by saying it represents the south
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13361.wav|is mostly a relic of the past and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13363.wav|when cotton eye joe comes on at a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13364.wav|very much got that from the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13365.wav|that tells us there is no conflict
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13366.wav|not going to be nearly enough because as

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13377.wav|i'm guessing pretty taxing so by not

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13397.wav|hold on there mike who is the we in that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13398.wav|striking press conference
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13400.wav|a terrible society and i honestly cannot
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13402.wav|just look at the difference in how the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13403.wav|he expressed some views that are pretty
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13404.wav|warrior and that she was then arrested
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13407.wav|flagrant double standard baked into
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13409.wav|a whole plan and i know it is deeply
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13410.wav|at a historic black church

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13414.wav|says they're personal injury attorneys i
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13415.wav|and that very much set the tone for the

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13450.wav|it's one of the rare times we're
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13451.wav|was the misleading portrait they painted
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13455.wav|if nba players are too rich to take

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13658.wav|reforms that we've tried like the wider

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13660.wav|you forever Tucker Cal said you sentient
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13662.wav|white and not only does that incident
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13665.wav|that most labor unions simply don't have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13666.wav|Democrats have been spitballing ideas
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13668.wav|policies peak in of the nearly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13669.wav|this is a difficult moment and I really
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13670.wav|still being pushed today that testify
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13671.wav|and I'll say this having recently said
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13672.wav|of a grade-a but especially if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13673.wav|community's actual safety net things
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13674.wav|sunscreen and that's just one of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13675.wav|to Christmas since people decided that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13676.wav|recommended firing the officer whose
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13677.wav|precinct because they presumably thought
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13678.wav|that are embarrassingly small and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13679.wav|conversation to go beyond how should the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13680.wav|Mayor DeBlasio praised them for their
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13681.wav|many are advocating that we rethink
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13682.wav|from all of us black communities have

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13691.wav|they are proposing dead in its tracks
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13692.wav|we got to this point what the

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13696.wav|transgender people particularly trans
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13697.wav|honestly makes me slightly worried that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13700.wav|sexology is the scholarly study of the

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13709.wav|left unattended it will lead to more
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13710.wav|think that you really should and look
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13711.wav|he clearly has no interest in police
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13712.wav|that idea further than this guy once
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13714.wav|federal government won't act what else
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13717.wav|people still went about their lives
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13720.wav|government does that depends on who is

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13725.wav|of Minneapolis announcing the officers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13726.wav|absolutely does not mean that we

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13729.wav|church while holding up a Bible like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13731.wav|that protesters right what the does
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13732.wav|look we're gonna do something a little
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13733.wav|momentum right now is defunding the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13734.wav|representing TV writers fight for their

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13736.wav|with an op-ed titled

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13738.wav|Safety that relies on policing and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13739.wav|why we need to bring Hitler back to life

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13743.wav|alarmed on his very bad face defund the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13744.wav|you must feel not only this week but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13745.wav|Wow you know it's bad enough when it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13746.wav|police officers are often protective in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13747.wav|concept is that the role of the police
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13748.wav|decree in which the police department
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13749.wav|percent drop in misdemeanor arrests and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13750.wav|in settlements and court judgments and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13752.wav|just a bunch of random
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13754.wav|biggest issues is police unions even in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13757.wav|as the summer of chromatic err and look
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13758.wav|and negotiate language into contracts
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13759.wav|tolerance policing had started to take
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13760.wav|housing opportunities not always
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13761.wav|trainings days a year
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13762.wav|million dollars meaning that,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13763.wav|cannot live among them and I know that's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13764.wav|at unfortunately some prominent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13766.wav|remembered one day by white historians
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13767.wav|going vegan but this clearly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13771.wav|just listen to one officer
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13772.wav|communities of color and gave way to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13773.wav|boring elected accountant whose title
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13774.wav|world as potential prey and of course
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13775.wav|sticks and sometimes assaulting the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13776.wav|the day only to have to almost
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13777.wav|had please gas protesters outside the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13778.wav|inexplicable photo op and a nearby
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13779.wav|disproportionately falls on black
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13780.wav|Minneapolis offed his Union to accept a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13781.wav|what appliance he used now the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13782.wav|actually worth taking a moment to talk
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13783.wav|many cases you're contending with an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13784.wav|because he cooked his victims in an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13786.wav|this just under a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13788.wav|how enraging that is they're protesting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13789.wav|procreative Act if you want anyone to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13791.wav|there his determination to train police
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13792.wav|workers that is what they do but police
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13794.wav|unforgivable and actually to that point
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13795.wav|needlessly arming police to the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13796.wav|study of the destructive act just as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13799.wav|but we need so much more than that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13800.wav|their own going to cut it I'm not saying
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13801.wav|there's one person I saw this week whose
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13802.wav|that meant that in many communities the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13806.wav|children in schools or really any other
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13808.wav|someone showing up with a gun that is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13809.wav|thought called broken windows or zero
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13810.wav|late s a commission was set up to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13811.wav|there that the key question is not if an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13812.wav|women of color and instead consider that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13813.wav|the while as we were continuing to boost
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13815.wav|listen I'm no comptroller believe me I
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13816.wav|and as batshit as Grossman is he is by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13817.wav|inferiority but the police have not just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13818.wav|right now well that's obviously absurd
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13819.wav|meditation or yoga or just kidding
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13820.wav|he yields his time realizes he still has
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13821.wav|a barber by saying here is scissors snip
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13822.wav|there's actually a bill in Congress
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13823.wav|that are then overseen by a federal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13824.wav|question and in high-profile cases
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13825.wav|the purge instead it's about moving away
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13826.wav|legitimately terrifying and it's hard to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13827.wav|White House so that chunk could have an
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13828.wav|his Justice Department launched twelve
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13829.wav|about that term theory basically
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13830.wav|procreative Act which oh and also I'm
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13831.wav|that by the summer of there were a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13832.wav|you've seen used to control and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13833.wav|that mean because one hamburger should
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13834.wav|suspect in a canal in the woods which I
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13835.wav|different kinds of outdoor holes and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13836.wav|about the police because all week we've
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13837.wav|enforcing segregation while allowing and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13838.wav|wildly unsuccessful Bible salesman and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13840.wav|reform in george w bush his first term

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13843.wav|usually were and rats still dragged
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13844.wav|most basic common-sense reform a few
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13845.wav|no means a fringe figure in police
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13847.wav|confused but mostly scared and look as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13848.wav|streets in all states in the wake of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13849.wav|can you do as a civilian to get
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13850.wav|great day for him which is utterly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13851.wav|percent drop in felony arrests and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13852.wav|won't need to use this % of the time
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13853.wav|that we shouldn't still try them but in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13854.wav|Commission meeting held over zoom now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13855.wav|make sure that their voices are heard
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13856.wav|urologist but guys like bob rolling his

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13859.wav|the officer who shot falando Castille
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13860.wav|name Macy's more than you've said the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13861.wav|cops are at war and perhaps no one takes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13863.wav|compelling argument and that wasn't even
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13864.wav|that were explicitly designed to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13865.wav|left so unyielding and throws in a bonus
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13866.wav|a percent drop in moving violations
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13868.wav|that was just called he also in

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13871.wav|relate to both a drop in excessive force

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13876.wav|is an issue of a few bad actors in fact
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13877.wav|could wind up on edge you wouldn't train

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13879.wav|they just aren't equipped to handle
../../input/johnoliver/wav/13881.wav|Americans is just one of many physical

../../input/johnoliver/wav/13887.wav|case and I do mean exact because small

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14075.wav|agrees to make institutional changes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14076.wav|it illegal for police to use choke holds
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14077.wav|inspecting it then his attorney general
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14078.wav|pretty sure that the first lesson in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14079.wav|qualified immunity means that a public
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14080.wav|statement policing did slow down in New

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14085.wav|culture he's on the road giving
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14087.wav|essentially allow police officers who
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14088.wav|was murdered police use force against

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14092.wav|which years ago was pleased by a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14093.wav|is a blessing for they must be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14095.wav|incredibly difficult a Washington Post
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14096.wav|the budget for the Minneapolis Police
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14097.wav|would mean that we've maybe all consider
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14098.wav|from a narrow conception of Public
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14099.wav|at their disposal when the unions
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14100.wav|sometimes participating in lynchings and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14101.wav|analysis of some of the nation's largest
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14102.wav|have long enjoyed an exalted role in

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14104.wav|the kind of Alice in Wonderland with the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14106.wav|well that just gets even cooler and all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14107.wav|like and if a city doesn't feel that it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14109.wav|before that commission was the social
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14110.wav|rats families after a hard day of rats
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14113.wav|participants more than you are asking
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14114.wav|it's now been a year and a half since
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14115.wav|institution not deeply entangled with

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14117.wav|that Tucker Carlson has the exact level
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14118.wav|they were met there yet again by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14119.wav|like my favorite part is that after he's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14120.wav|departments in a bombers first term it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14122.wav|obstacles to reform have been and what
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14124.wav|union there Bob thrall announced plans
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14125.wav|racism that this country created
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14126.wav|proof that our current system is working
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14128.wav|through some of the history here because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14129.wav|cops who went through this training
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14130.wav|for instance one case was thrown out
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14131.wav|excessive force by police and the police
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14132.wav|gonna do shoot me I don't think so think
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14134.wav|constantly medical groups say police
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14136.wav|this child's born in the Middle East was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14139.wav|might be thinking well join the club
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14140.wav|riot of the report of the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14142.wav|someone that they're a predator is that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14143.wav|everything else as somehow frivolous in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14144.wav|use of body cameras and implicit bias
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14146.wav|actually gonna be about one thing and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14147.wav|constant calls to increase the number of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14150.wav|above punishment actually brings us to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14151.wav|and enter what is called a consent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14152.wav|pro creatively act with you ever again
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14154.wav|so if the union's won't act and the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14155.wav|to know that the union can stop whatever
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14156.wav|address three basic questions how the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14157.wav|there are a lot of suggestions to look
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14158.wav|going to focus on Trump tonight nor are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14159.wav|the opportunity would come quite this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14160.wav|part of a much larger system of racial
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14161.wav|planter said in the wake of emancipation
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14162.wav|the continued denial of economic and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14163.wav|that happened one of those officers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14164.wav|impacted by it it is tempting to look
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14165.wav|as essentially the only public resource
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14166.wav|industry of police training has also
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14167.wav|take it a step slower he just basically
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14168.wav|shows like cranky gun grandpa and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14169.wav|over again the same analysis the same
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14171.wav|hundreds and hundreds of videos and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14172.wav|marches taking place all around the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14173.wav|something you get from a horrifying
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14174.wav|to focus primarily on them and try to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14175.wav|any issue that people had which is a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14176.wav|with dogs you know what he's absolutely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14177.wav|theories and went in the wake of that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14178.wav|black in America I can't even begin to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14179.wav|bit different tonight our whole show is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14180.wav|complaints and some rebuilding of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14181.wav|being disenfranchised and it is long
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14182.wav|a problem with what they did and to his
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14184.wav|our final point here what do we do now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14185.wav|being morally reprehensible it is a tool
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14186.wav|the risk of killing someone is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14187.wav|that it's been easy perfect or even that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14190.wav|about a structure built on systemic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14192.wav|attention over a long period of time
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14193.wav|you instead tonight let's talk
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14196.wav|Ferguson officer who killed him
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14197.wav|of view I mean they didn't but they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14198.wav|to a defense attorney explain one reason
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14200.wav|a while so now I'm gonna let her have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14201.wav|raise serious questions about those
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14202.wav|say all the right things it's important
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14203.wav|it's a lot more alarming when that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14204.wav|by just acknowledging that the police
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14205.wav|policing this is America the only
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14206.wav|tonight what the major obstacles to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14207.wav|he's shared by many politicians in New
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14209.wav|everything and work on your problem
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14211.wav|official is immune from lawsuits unless
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14214.wav|clearly shouldn't matter it's like if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14215.wav|important to remember that we got here
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14216.wav|they are not responding to the homeless
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14217.wav|officer used to assault that woman
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14218.wav|alone someone who looks like a Boyles

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14220.wav|or to mental health calls or arresting

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14222.wav|officers to be predators his air of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14223.wav|things did not improve from the s on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14224.wav|that makes removing a problem officer
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14227.wav|it's genuinely impossible to overstate
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14228.wav|at least eighteen hundred and eighty-one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14230.wav|military equipment just listen to what
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14231.wav|services and community organizations the

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14237.wav|pushback against institutional racism
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14238.wav|precisely what led to the death of Eric
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14239.wav|course the expression complexion and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14240.wav|faced with accountability that they
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14241.wav|officers it also implicates the entire
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14242.wav|taken many forms from chance to signs to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14243.wav|but if you don't think you can make that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14244.wav|has to settle with you you're in real
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14246.wav|immediately walk that statement back say
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14247.wav|main job is to see lawlessness and stop
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14248.wav|inexplicably took a real word and then
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14249.wav|police were the only ones left to handle
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14250.wav|situation where the best solution is not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14252.wav|Frost sucked by dick and choke on it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14253.wav|want to talk about how we got here it's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14254.wav|such investigations into police
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14255.wav|the heroes of beloved movies and TV
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14256.wav|members the worst thing that they can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14258.wav|look I get union's fighting for their
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14259.wav|fact remember Bob Kroll but when
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14260.wav|to reinstate more than of them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14261.wav|president and it always
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14263.wav|of policing is and has always been very
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14264.wav|observation which remains depressingly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14265.wav|is absolutely ridiculous the method the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14266.wav|Jeffrey Dahmer was declared innocent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14267.wav|take that glib dismissal from anyone let
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14269.wav|on misconduct settlements you might want
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14270.wav|leasing a police dog to bite a compliant
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14271.wav|protesters have continued to fill the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14272.wav|protests which have been a stirring

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14277.wav|unleashing a police dog to bite a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14279.wav|uncomfortable for me to say but if we
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14281.wav|and psychological factors that make
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14282.wav|it's important to understand how deeply
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14283.wav|settle for astonishing amounts in fact
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14286.wav|trouble because civil suits against cops

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14289.wav|paperwork is a greater deterrent to

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14291.wav|you if you're spending a billion dollars
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14292.wav|I really wouldn't be holding that up as

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14295.wav|aggressive policing was accompanied by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14297.wav|we have the power to pass stringent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14298.wav|officers who belonged to our friend

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14374.wav|for a reason to feel better about the

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14501.wav|look clearly the police are just one

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14505.wav|what I turned on qualified immunity and

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14508.wav|police unions can also oppose even the

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14525.wav|I bet they had a lot of fun on set,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14526.wav|a full week after the election was called,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14527.wav|That's awful.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14529.wav|That is either total bullshit or the dumbest scheme of all time.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14530.wav|Mitch McConnell not only claimed Trump is percent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14533.wav|would simply acknowledge that they lost,

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14535.wav|those claims in his affidavit when talking to investigators.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14536.wav|to the election was pretty much the same
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14538.wav|one vote that was flagged in September,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14539.wav|That is like if in Oceans they showed up to the casino
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14542.wav|let's look at just how weak Trump's case
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14543.wav|Sounds less like Muhammad Ali and more like a blurb
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14544.wav|Either because you can no longer square your love for them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14546.wav|But according to me, you can go ahead and drop
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14547.wav|So look, I could spend the rest of this show
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14548.wav|is putting ballot votes into a paper shredder.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14550.wav|their date changed was two,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14552.wav|The latest claim is voting machines or software
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14554.wav|by a postal worker in Erie, Pennsylvania,

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14556.wav|Look how yellow it is!
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14558.wav|of how funny that sounds. Here is what I think happened.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14559.wav|sent a letter to the DOJ,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14560.wav|It's really good!
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14561.wav|which I don't think is purgatory,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14562.wav|by the actor Jon Voight,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14563.wav|Matt Gaetz and the Trump campaign itself.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14564.wav|Yeah. That's one person allegedly trying to steal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14565.wav|I would much rather spend tonight
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14566.wav|of ballots from his post office,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14567.wav|outside the polling place with people handling white envelopes. Go!
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14568.wav|what has been disappointing has been shit like this.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14569.wav|Okay, so the claim was bullshit.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14570.wav|"I stand here," when he's clearly sitting,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14571.wav|The claim of dead people voting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14572.wav|her identity by making her sound like
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14573.wav|about a threat to the vote-counting site.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14574.wav|nonsense claims that he won Pennsylvania and one long reply
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14575.wav|still coming to you from this blank void,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14576.wav|at the worst possible time.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14577.wav|It looks like it went to a costume party
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14579.wav|Well, I don't know, some shit like that.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14580.wav|-"Those are ballots." -Okay. I'm just gonna say it.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14581.wav|the fact that Trump won't be president next year is good.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14582.wav|But who's gonna call us out on that?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14583.wav|because in normal times,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14584.wav|nor have most Republicans.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14585.wav|You're supposed to forcefully denounce coups
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14587.wav|and delivered to the board of elections later.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14588.wav|a single whiteboard in Jared's office
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14589.wav|what they're actually filing in court.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14590.wav|So, the maximum number that could've had
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14591.wav|Not only, of those that he's attacked, but also,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14592.wav|because we thought it was funny."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14594.wav|calling Bill de Blasio a bitch on Twitter?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14595.wav|and Obama had Trump in the White House
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14596.wav|And he went in big on one example in particular.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14597.wav|And to be clear, people who are that angry
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14598.wav|involved a poll worker in Nevada who Fox gave
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14600.wav|they were postmarked November rd
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14601.wav|things are going to suck for a while.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14602.wav|I really hope so.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14603.wav|the election's outcome is that Biden is not getting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14605.wav|Trump is still refusing to concede.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14606.wav|And if it helps here, let me just head-off
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14607.wav|I wonder what else they have in common.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14608.wav|Which is pathetic, dangerous and many ways,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14610.wav|changed votes even though
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14611.wav|Forty Fort without being fully aware
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14612.wav|Megan Mullaly undergoing an exorcism.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14613.wav|to make it appear as though
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14615.wav|But I'll let her continue.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14616.wav|with the turtle mafia while trying to disguise itself
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14617.wav|and slowly put on their disguises in the lobby.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14618.wav|According to experts...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14619.wav|all they've received is...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14620.wav|about dead voters. If your uncle is a nightmare
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14621.wav|Whose truck is that?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14622.wav|to be able to talk to the old team.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14623.wav|were being backdated on mail-in ballots
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14624.wav|But perhaps the strangest whistleblower accusation
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14625.wav|were just two rats squished around a used condom,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14626.wav|Hillary formally conceded the day after the election,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14627.wav|you really want the new team handling the pandemic,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14629.wav|And most importantly, Trump himself.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14630.wav|Yeah! And that's not great.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14631.wav|Also, that woman hasn't yet filed a formal complaint.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14632.wav|for Trump's indefensible behavior
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14635.wav|Instead, they're either allegations from people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14636.wav|against the side of a van which had their logo on it.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14637.wav|we have to talk about this asshole
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14638.wav|meaning this -year-old's approach
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14639.wav|And while is he now insisting that he stands by his initial statements,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14643.wav|and look the other way if the CIA does one
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14644.wav|It looks like he got into some trouble
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14645.wav|with nothing on it except for...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14646.wav|are trying to defend their support
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14647.wav|According to the Nevada AG's office,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14648.wav|In fact, as of this taping, one of the few
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14649.wav|but I can't prove otherwise.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14650.wav|and that has been something of a pattern here.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14652.wav|but I call bullshit on that because I refuse to believe
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14653.wav|so are questioning some pretty commonplace things
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14654.wav|They wouldn't be going to all this trouble over nothing."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14655.wav|Meaning exactly zero were dead people who voted.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14657.wav|but there then being a huge drop off when it comes to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14659.wav|of conspiracy theories that he happily perpetuated.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14660.wav|of right-wing media, you might think,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14661.wav|the loser of a presidential election
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14662.wav|And infuriatingly,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14663.wav|putting Joe Biden at electoral votes, to Trump's.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14665.wav|Leslie Jordan's absolute worst character,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14666.wav|the next cookie that comes past you.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14667.wav|that he'll be a power broker going forward. I don't know.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14668.wav|A question that never ends well,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14669.wav|of a polling place in broad daylight
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14670.wav|"Wait! What if someone asks why we called it Forty Fort?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14671.wav|Because it also plays into grim fantasies
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14672.wav|by the chaos engulfing his office.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14673.wav|But we have to try and repair this damage.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14674.wav|Who's Twitter feed this week
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14676.wav|debunking stories. The problem is it's endless.

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14680.wav|The Trump team making claims of widespread fraud publicly,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14681.wav|Then, there were claims from numerous supposed whistleblowers.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14682.wav|Forty Fort. It feel so good in the mouth.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14684.wav|you might well not risk trusting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14686.wav|with one senior official saying...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14687.wav|the final states were called by most outlets,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14688.wav|The Biden-Harris campaign opened envelopes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14689.wav|despite the fact that deep down, he knows it's over.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14690.wav|Okay. First, no one expected Trump to immediately,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14691.wav|a primetime slot to make her claims.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14692.wav|And another said, "Who cares. Let's just call it Forty Fort."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14694.wav|Last Thursday, two armed men were arrested outside

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14696.wav|"Well, there must be something here.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14697.wav|I'm just as disappointed as you about that.

../../input/johnoliver/wav/14702.wav|Basically she claims she saw a Biden-Harris campaign van
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14703.wav|Hi there. Welcome to the show,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14704.wav|because there are lots of accusations and lawsuits
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14706.wav|Or, because he let a deadly virus run wild
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14707.wav|he was retweeting voter fraud conspiracies again.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14708.wav|From doubling down on calling the left "Satan," to saying,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14709.wav|and the opportunity to scream inside a stranger's truck.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14710.wav|who need a break or the Weimar Republic.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14711.wav|and it fucking killed them!
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14712.wav|for voter fraud this year has been this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14713.wav|cheerfully accept the results.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14714.wav|But the damage of indulging Trump goes even further.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14715.wav|Except no, time will not tell, time has told!
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14716.wav|So, then they said, "Okay.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14718.wav|how the vote counting process works
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14719.wav|and they want to keep Trump happy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14720.wav|an s ski bully who just lost the big race.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14721.wav|to a presidency that has destroyed so many lives.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14723.wav|In fact, Lindsey Graham,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14724.wav|Or the wit of...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14725.wav|It doesn't have the rhetorical flair of...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14726.wav|One humming the chorus of "Uptown Girl" is not evidence of voter fraud.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14727.wav|If it's just the hat part, that again is not evidence of voter fraud.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14728.wav|Ooh, that's an excellent question,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14731.wav|the day after that. And yet, Republicans
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14732.wav|And let's start with the frequently made claim
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14733.wav|within his rights to challenge the election results,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14734.wav|And yes, that is just a sample,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14735.wav|"Oh, my God, Ezekiel. You suck so much,"
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14736.wav|This really is nothing.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14737.wav|in charge of ballot-counting,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14738.wav|that there just happened to be settlers who named their fort
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14739.wav|concerns the election we just had, and believe me,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14741.wav|whether the ones asking it are overworked parents
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14742.wav|"What should we call this place?"
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14743.wav|of voter fraud, but only if the person wearing it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14745.wav|to that Muhammad Ali quote which we could not find
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14746.wav|of those he's claimed to protect.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14748.wav|and marked ballots in the parking lot
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14749.wav|with our main story this week,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14751.wav|You're the Secretary of State.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14752.wav|of embattled Trump supporters.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14753.wav|But the thing is they are.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14755.wav|They built the fort, and one settler said,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14756.wav|And while some have suggested that Pompeo was joking there,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14757.wav|I will take that story to my gravy grave.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14758.wav|"Not my president" and "Not the president."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14759.wav|just a few hours later, he nearly acknowledged reality.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14760.wav|because I guarantee, no one else did.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14761.wav|Just say the words "Forty Fort" out loud right now.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14762.wav|he went on to say this.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14765.wav|Now, that segment got picked up and circulated by among others,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14766.wav|And when you continually insist that the election was stolen
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14767.wav|and spends five hours a day
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14770.wav|but those who actually read them found that they...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14773.wav|with their love for him.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14774.wav|or they are petty bullshit like...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14775.wav|And we're gonna jump straight in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14776.wav|But as of our taping on Saturday,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14777.wav|and a victim narrative from outlets like...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14778.wav|of affidavits from poll watchers,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14779.wav|the original settlers who built a fort there,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14780.wav|they discovered...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14782.wav|in big cities and suggest that remedying this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14783.wav|to Scott Baio, who you might know from Happy Days or from...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14784.wav|was also advanced by Tucker Carlson,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14786.wav|Maybe they're carrying favor with him because they're worried
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14787.wav|What the fuck are you talking about, you business Grimace?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14788.wav|Because this administration's refusal to acknowledge
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14790.wav|Neither of which are illegal.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14791.wav|Now, apparently the town was named after
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14794.wav|A poll worker eating a banana is not evidence of voter fraud.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14795.wav|things start to get deadly serious.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14796.wav|and the country would get to move on.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14797.wav|Even if, as I suspect, the old team's plan was just
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14801.wav|the really important thing to know is the total number
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14802.wav|and agreed to do just that.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14803.wav|so it'll help rally voters for them there.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14804.wav|about this shiny, cheddar cheese mistake, but instead,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14805.wav|on a bootleg VHS cover of Rocky IV.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14806.wav|I tell you who definitely doesn't care. This guy.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14807.wav|It's fucking and most people can't read.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14808.wav|dressed as the less healthy part of the egg.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14810.wav|And sure, that's a ridiculous video,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14812.wav|But unfortunately for Graham, that man later recanted
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14813.wav|of widespread voter fraud in this election.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14815.wav|Trump is somehow managing to divide us even further,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14816.wav|but when CNN picked out of the names to do a spot check,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14817.wav|So many of us have lost loved ones.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14820.wav|a Republican, by the way, has been understandably rattled
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14821.wav|Friday afternoon,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14822.wav|It's the perfect crime!
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14823.wav|calls for the biggest fight since the Civil War,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14824.wav|that little factoid in a file labeled "Who gives a shit?"
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14827.wav|who don't seem to fully understand
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14828.wav|Then another settler, who no one really liked, said,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14829.wav|And while that is not remotely surprising,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14830.wav|talking about this rare turtle found in West Bengal.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14831.wav|With cases spiking to a terrifying extent,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14832.wav|What I do know is that the answer to the question
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14833.wav|Trump has chosen to sow all this chaos around the election,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14834.wav|which unfortunately, for the second week in a row,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14836.wav|which is, and this is true, not the number of votes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14838.wav|Because there is a huge difference between
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14839.wav|an appropriate code
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14840.wav|this government cyber security agency created by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14841.wav|And yet, just an hour after that press conference,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14842.wav|high level intelligence reports and can't access funds
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14843.wav|Maybe it's to do with the fact that Georgia has
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14846.wav|of, dead people who voted in Michigan,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14847.wav|And let's start with the case itself
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14848.wav|and you're still friends on Facebook,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14849.wav|you might have seen this post claiming there a list
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14850.wav|And who knows why Republicans are entertaining this.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14851.wav|And everyone justifiably laughed very hard
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14853.wav|We can't just say we did it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14854.wav|That is literally your whole job.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14855.wav|are not riling themselves up in a vacuum.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14856.wav|a Philadelphia convention center after police had received a tip
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14860.wav|any future Trump campaign lawsuits.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14861.wav|you waiter's nightmare.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14862.wav|And second, while there were some on the left in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14863.wav|while also hobbling his successor
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14864.wav|And during a press conference Trump held,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14867.wav|meant to facilitate his transition.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14868.wav|In Michigan, they submitted a lawsuit with pages
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14869.wav|seemingly legitimate cases against anyone
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14870.wav|Meaning they have no way to begin a proper investigation
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14871.wav|He's incapable of cheerfully accepting anything
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14872.wav|And by the way, not so much for Biden
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14874.wav|oscillated between Breitbart articles,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14875.wav|he also hasn't yet acknowledged that Biden is president-elect
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14876.wav|and then a drawing of Donald Trump saying...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14877.wav|And Trump is playing a dangerous game here.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14878.wav|And this is not the most important thing,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14879.wav|in a giant Danny Ocean's robbery service van,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14880.wav|as that of -year-old progressives.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14883.wav|Now, wearing a baseball cap could be evidence
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14884.wav|And that is how Forty Fort got its name.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14885.wav|He didn't vote. She did.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14886.wav|an act that Trump himself signed released a statement saying...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14887.wav|Or because they fell down a mind-melting rabbit hole
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14889.wav|Oh, sorry I really should've mentioned they disguised
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14891.wav|in this video that Trump himself retweeted on Wednesday.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14892.wav|who urged fighting the results,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14893.wav|In fact, as a great fighter once said...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14894.wav|as a peanut M&M.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14895.wav|but the fact is, a lot of people believe stuff like that.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14896.wav|Joe Biden won Pennsylvania by.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14897.wav|to back that up as Republicans currently do
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14898.wav|Does she also have a collection of dank memes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14900.wav|So, the allegations here are complete nonsense.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14901.wav|and what real harm humoring him will do.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14902.wav|Where he starred alongside none other than Jon Voight.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14903.wav|And it does make you wonder how did that dead man vote.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14904.wav|Something expressed perhaps most dramatically and stupidly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14906.wav|Okay. There's a lot there.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14908.wav|Maybe his widow has an answer.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14909.wav|They've been fed a steady diet
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14911.wav|And yes,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14912.wav|because it doesn't really sound like Muhammad Ali.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14913.wav|Because look how fucking yellow that turtle is!
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14914.wav|apart from blowjobs, Nazi endorsements,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14915.wav|which is just delightful.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14916.wav|flying around right now, and if you are a casual viewer
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14917.wav|who said in an affidavit, that he heard postmarks
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14921.wav|and out of Oreos you picked off the line
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14923.wav|for overturning this election is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14924.wav|what is the downside of humoring him is a lot.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14925.wav|and the person involved was a Trump supporter.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14926.wav|but you are at an Oreo factory
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14927.wav|in Central or South America.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14928.wav|they'd been collected on Election Day.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14929.wav|If anyone asks, we called it Forty Fort
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14930.wav|any record of him saying. Which does make sense
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14931.wav|but it happened in a town called Forty Fort,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14934.wav|Trump lost this election and he knows it.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14935.wav|of misinformation, bullshit fraud claims
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14936.wav|Trump's top immigration advisor and world's tallest minion,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14937.wav|something the baker insisted was Lupita Nyong'o and, I admit,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14938.wav|But the thing is,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14940.wav|in some ways, she's actually luckier
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14941.wav|it gives me authority to shut down the border
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14942.wav|good luck figuring out how to follow them.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14944.wav|Remember Berta, who came here
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14945.wav|migrant protectant protocols, safe third country agreements,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14946.wav|If someone says, "I'm drowning,"
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14948.wav|fleeing persecution and make it to the U.S. can apply to stay here.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14949.wav|Trump's Head of Customs and Border Protection,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14950.wav|in U.S. immigration courts rather than
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14951.wav|is comfortably bad enough,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14952.wav|So, tonight let's talk about our asylum system,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14953.wav|So the asylum process has never been easy,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14954.wav|unaccompanied minors are usually kept in shelters,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14955.wav|but that seemingly wasn't enough because the administration
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14956.wav|of family separation, but each represents
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14957.wav|when he asked, 'Who are you?' But then, Randy said,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14958.wav|have been absolutely chilling.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14959.wav|about this mysteriously off-limits hotel floor
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14960.wav|it's proof your system is not fucking working.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14961.wav|than many asylum seekers like her.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14962.wav|everyone should be able to support.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14963.wav|and the arena for a shame-based banking crucible
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14964.wav|That baker deserves a poor Hollywood handshake.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14965.wav|So, this clearly has nothing to do with public health at all.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14966.wav|With immigration advocates saying less than half
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14967.wav|What qualifies as membership in a social group,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14968.wav|that moves quickly and is accountable to no one.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14969.wav|cartels will give some kidnapped migrants a code word
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14970.wav|a lot of our immigration policy is set solely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14971.wav|It's a provision that gives the government broad power
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14972.wav|He reportedly pushed to invoke it twice last year.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14974.wav|Far from it.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14975.wav|He's talking about murder victims
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14980.wav|to be the parents of someone Donald Trump wishes would fuck him.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14981.wav|of notebook paper is their only lifeline to safety,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14982.wav|No. No, it really isn't.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14983.wav|It's right next door so you can stay in touch with your family,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14984.wav|to act during a public health crisis.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14985.wav|who regularly kidnap and try to extract ransom money
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14986.wav|whose only price
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14987.wav|They were separated, Berta was detained,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14988.wav|...which have to be in English and with all supporting evidence
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14989.wav|Believe me. We'll ruin the dish.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14990.wav|For instance, someone being persecuted for criticizing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14992.wav|And those could be life-saving changes.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14993.wav|those are the exact countries they're seeking asylum from.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14994.wav|that their criticism is political
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14995.wav|to avoid scrutiny here. For example,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14996.wav|and try and help them. But by citing public health concerns,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14997.wav|And I know that sounds simplistic,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/14998.wav|Because the entity you're definitely angriest at right now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15001.wav|throwing you into detention, you'd be absolutely furious.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15002.wav|as Trump's official White House website calls it...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15004.wav|their deep concern about the coronavirus
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15005.wav|has been pretty shitty under Democratic administrations, too,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15006.wav|where you should know she once again fled
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15007.wav|Good luck getting the instructions
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15008.wav|Just an absolute shitload of cool "S's"? You know it.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15009.wav|The Trump administration's attack on asylum has been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15010.wav|That's the last time anyone asks us questions
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15011.wav|and the victims of gang persecution.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15012.wav|make the first showstopper challenge,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15013.wav|as painting...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15014.wav|when the administration invoked Title of the U.S. Code,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15015.wav|her -year-old granddaughter into marriage. Berta refused.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15016.wav|why this appeals so much to Miller
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15018.wav|but this administration has made it absolute hell.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15019.wav|Some migrants will receive notices to appear in court
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15020.wav|And when you put all of this together,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15021.wav|And since we also started limiting the number of people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15023.wav|and then just throwing it over the wall into Mexico.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15024.wav|Very basically, this policy forces asylum seekers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15026.wav|They're also claiming that it allows them to take
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15027.wav|associating with this administration,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15028.wav|that you're being persecuted on the basis of race,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15029.wav|because how the fuck have we let that be the best system
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15031.wav|a Trump official saying his actions have nothing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15032.wav|there is just no telling if or when
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15034.wav|of a ripped Stephen Miller and "maybe an all-white reboot
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15036.wav|religion, nationality, membership in a social group,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15037.wav|spread through immigration detention facilities,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15038.wav|they successfully hidden the government's child prison.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15039.wav|of all claims are granted.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15040.wav|without so much as a court hearing.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15041.wav|about being truly evil.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15042.wav|It is a transparent attempt to exploit this pandemic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15043.wav|by hot pilots, cute babies, and cute baby pilots.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15044.wav|that bear no date or time,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15045.wav|Okay. So there is a lot to unpack there.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15046.wav|Okay. Deeply weird metaphor aside there I will say this,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15047.wav|under the radar.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15048.wav|in a melting pot, don't include the English.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15049.wav|as this cartel member explains.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15050.wav|And forcing migrants to sit in refugee camps or sending them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15051.wav|because invoking Title
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15052.wav|It's absolutely central to the American story.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15053.wav|to wait in Mexico for their cases to fully play out
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15054.wav|Because migrants in general are targets for cartels,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15055.wav|to help them navigate a very complicated process,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15056.wav|your first move should be to help them out of the pool
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15057.wav|In fact, kidnappings are such a fact of life,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15058.wav|by this administration until we replace
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15059.wav|And obviously, Biden will have to do a lot more,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15060.wav|or a political opinion?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15061.wav|Moving on. Our main story tonight concerns immigration.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15062.wav|the odds of being granted asylum were not great.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15063.wav|to countries with no functioning asylum systems
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15064.wav|and expel them with no due process whatsoever.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15066.wav|the government's instead been quietly keeping kids
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15067.wav|And if you need any more proof, Stephen Miller,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15068.wav|by the executive branch and you should know
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15069.wav|But the fact is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15070.wav|the asylum process isn't a simple recitation
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15071.wav|and shattered it. And the thing is,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15072.wav|which is completely absurd.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15073.wav|"They end up where they end up."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15074.wav|and that is regardless of whether or not they have a lawyer.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15075.wav|and it's partly because the bar to qualify for asylum is high.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15077.wav|In fact, using emergency public health powers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15078.wav|that man's pitch-black joke about getting murdered,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15079.wav|Basically, the U.S. managed to force...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15081.wav|that I have to clarify that that Hampton Inn said
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15082.wav|in which asylum seekers were sent back
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15083.wav|with the same casualness most people reserve
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15084.wav|Biden has explicitly promised
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15085.wav|and migrants, forced by the U.S.,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15086.wav|but we can't begin to fix the damage done
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15087.wav|Because it gave us squashed Freddie Mercury,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15088.wav|and undisputed Chaddiest wolf,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15089.wav|and that isn't even an immigration law.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15090.wav|over, publicly reported cases of murder, rape, torture,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15091.wav|And yet despite the wreckage this administration has caused,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15092.wav|This is done so often, there is a whole system in place for it,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15093.wav|"Well, what can we do about this?"
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15094.wav|of magic words by which all manner
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15095.wav|to look at three tactics that they've used in particular,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15096.wav|for lost socks. And as of May, there were
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15098.wav|from seeking asylum here
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15099.wav|And there's always going to be room
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15101.wav|And the government's gone out of its way
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15102.wav|they'll even get that far. And if you're wondering,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15103.wav|to determine whether or not they're a fish who's lying.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15104.wav|'Cause the fact is we badly need an asylum system that works.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15105.wav|of fraudulent claims are let through
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15106.wav|of hearings, given that some border patrol agents,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15108.wav|utterly ridiculous, especially in the middle of a pandemic.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15109.wav|You can vote for Joe Biden.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15110.wav|He went on about asylum at length in Thursday's debate,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15112.wav|in a camp in Matamoros
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15113.wav|and there are lives at stake here.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15114.wav|on this show, but tonight we're gonna focus
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15115.wav|packed with terrified children."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15116.wav|to virtually all migrants."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15117.wav|Throwing up a tent doesn't inherently give you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15118.wav|without adequate shelter or support,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15119.wav|this administration has undermined it.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15120.wav|Math homework? Sure.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15121.wav|And Berta's story isn't even a one-off.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15122.wav|on just one narrow area of it, asylum.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15124.wav|Because remember, these hearings
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15125.wav|Although, I will say I'm actually curious
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15126.wav|where there was only one toilet for every people
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15127.wav|We're bland and yet also totally overpowering to the palate.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15128.wav|for interpretation there.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15129.wav|his actions have nothing to do with cookies.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15130.wav|many migrants don't have a lawyer
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15133.wav|if they're sent back home, they're allowed to remain
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15135.wav|Historically, the biggest loophole has been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15136.wav|Ideally,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15137.wav|and safe drinking water was scarce.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15138.wav|can be in real jeopardy.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15140.wav|Something definitively disproven by the existence of Post Malone.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15141.wav|where immigration attorneys can find them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15142.wav|Now, you should know, even before Trump,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15143.wav|if after that interaction, those men felt
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15145.wav|Also, as you've probably guessed,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15147.wav|have had to work out a system for whose turn it was next.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15148.wav|many of whom wound up in make-shift camps
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15149.wav|When a person says their life is at stake,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15151.wav|tattooed UFC fighters, they're also people like Berta,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15152.wav|And that is ideally one based on compassion,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15153.wav|was just what looks like a hand-drawn picture
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15154.wav|the "Remain in Mexico" program.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15155.wav|and restore asylum eligibility for domestic violence survivors
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15156.wav|Starting with the fact that Trump seems to think
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15157.wav|like lives depend on it.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15158.wav|He looks like a build a bear who spend too much time
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15159.wav|And not just that.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15160.wav|as the President of El Salvador, himself, admits.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15161.wav|You'd probably also be Black, but let's try and take this

../../input/johnoliver/wav/15165.wav|completely unnecessarily, to wait in Mexico.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15166.wav|they've drafted new regulations that would among other things...

../../input/johnoliver/wav/15168.wav|to end the "Remain in Mexico" policy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15169.wav|that the CDC was apparently forced
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15170.wav|an asylum seeker presents themselves to ask for protection
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15171.wav|of Hidden Figures?" circled three times.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15173.wav|who the Statue of Liberty has for centuries fricasseed.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15175.wav|or the lawyer taking it at complete face value.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15176.wav|has apparently been trying to invoke Title
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15178.wav|We're basically the cilantro of the human race.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15179.wav|and is currently living in limbo in Mexico.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15181.wav|what they'd be used for and have canceled their business.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15182.wav|or political opinion.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15183.wav|The Trump administration's attack on this system
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15184.wav|it literally makes you a monster.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15185.wav|but in this one area, they've been truly disciplined
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15186.wav|acting on our behalf, deported Berta back to Honduras,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15187.wav|But Trump is famously not a fan.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15188.wav|for immigration purposes long before COVID.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15190.wav|for many asylum seekers to enter the country,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15191.wav|Why the fuck did the new season of The Great British Bake Off
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15193.wav|in a college-ruled notebook.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15194.wav|in the U.S. pending a date in immigration court
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15195.wav|"Because of the pandemic,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15197.wav|But the Trump administration has told immigration judges
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15198.wav|But they have done so much more than that.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15199.wav|friends and the people who want to murder you."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15200.wav|the administration itself.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15201.wav|And conditions on the border can be dire.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15202.wav|and send them to apply for it in those countries instead,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15205.wav|and he loves to rift about it whenever he gets in front of a crowd.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15207.wav|Although, Mark Morgan,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15208.wav|that have emerged at the border.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15209.wav|And it's pretty bleak when drug cartels
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15211.wav|and if they miss their hearing, they lose their case.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15212.wav|kidnapping, and other violent assaults against asylum seekers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15213.wav|We've already done this to over, people,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15214.wav|to do with immigration is about as believable
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15215.wav|and an officer performs "a credible fear screening."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15216.wav|within just days of their first court hearing,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15217.wav|if you're cooking a bunch of humans
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15218.wav|caused widespread outrage.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15219.wav|Now, that is partly because, as we've discussed before,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15220.wav|to curb immigration was apparently on a wish list
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15221.wav|an asylum system that was already imperfect
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15222.wav|The rest of you need to think about what you've done.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15224.wav|the government system is about as effective
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15225.wav|She, at least, had a lawyer, and her case was heard.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15227.wav|And let's start with the migrant protection protocols.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15229.wav|And it meant that we could bar migrants
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15230.wav|And it's a little hard to take this administration citing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15231.wav|There are only two things throwing up a tent can give you
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15232.wav|at the tattoo station.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15233.wav|So this program all but shut off the pathway
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15234.wav|And asylum seekers are a group that, in theory,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15235.wav|...to sign up to this.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15236.wav|And even people who don't wind up in those camps
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15238.wav|one systemic social crisis at a time.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15240.wav|A list of the cutest boys in homeroom? Natch.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15241.wav|And for the record, asylum seekers are not all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15242.wav|has just been relentless,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15243.wav|and I'll let her lawyer pick up the story from there.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15244.wav|of asylum seekers than the U.S. government.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15245.wav|What the fuck is happening there?!
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15246.wav|it has trumpeted its "Remain in Mexico" program
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15247.wav|you wanna err on the side of believing them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15250.wav|In February, more than, migrants were living
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15251.wav|upon release, so if they're kidnapped again,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15252.wav|And the Trump administration is currently claiming that,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15253.wav|Their policy of family separation
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15254.wav|as this attorney explains to a room full of asylum seekers.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15255.wav|have a more efficient system for keeping track
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15257.wav|Wow, I don't know what's more jarring there,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15258.wav|shelter from the elements
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15260.wav|You have to be able to prove
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15261.wav|and Title.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15262.wav|is the narrow avoidance of public failure.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15263.wav|it is on us to vote and then advocate
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15264.wav|to protect her -year-old granddaughter?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15265.wav|and again, when border patrol stations were hit with the flu.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15266.wav|to issue the Title order, despite their own scientists
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15267.wav|Get fucked, Chad, you human razor burn.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15268.wav|And I know that none of those have the harrowing ring
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15269.wav|What you wouldn't expect though, would be the names
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15270.wav|Now incidentally, our lawyers are insisting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15271.wav|That's very funny, but seriously if you could die
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15272.wav|celebrity cake busts?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15273.wav|If we even want a shot at change,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15274.wav|while you weigh the facts of their case.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15275.wav|none of these three countries have robust asylum systems,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15277.wav|They are the literal huddled masses yearning to be free,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15278.wav|Just watch as a civil rights attorney
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15279.wav|It's everything they've been waiting for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15280.wav|Since March, there've been nearly, expulsions,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15282.wav|And it can be hard to know about any changes to dates
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15283.wav|that people with facial tattoos are just inherently scary.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15284.wav|saying there was no evidence it would slow the coronavirus.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15285.wav|a drug cartel might well argue
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15286.wav|due process, and of course, ultimately,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15287.wav|And it's worth slowing down right now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15288.wav|isn't proof they were trying to cheat the system,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15289.wav|It's the legal process by which people who are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15290.wav|and we will have to hold him to the promises he's made,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15292.wav|As it's sometimes clumsily expressed in cartoons like this.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15293.wav|And the tragic thing is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15294.wav|That is simply not true.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15295.wav|they had made those bookings without knowing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15296.wav|these hearings pretty missable.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15297.wav|has repeatedly insisted
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15298.wav|focused, dedicated, and deeply resourceful.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15299.wav|including one that was scheduled at a.m.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15300.wav|And if that wasn't bad enough,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15301.wav|And you can kind of see
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15302.wav|Also, I think aviator glasses should only be worn
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15305.wav|this administration has effectively taken
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15306.wav|And the rare glimpses that we've gotten of this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15307.wav|Look, there are plenty of things you'd expect to be handwritten
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15308.wav|Just watch her lawyer update her on the outcome of her case.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15309.wav|to apply the criteria very narrowly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15311.wav|'Don't worry who we are.' Nice save there, Randy.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15312.wav|because along with extending Title indefinitely,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15313.wav|to do whatever they want with migrants.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15314.wav|If there's a chance they might face danger
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15315.wav|"Oh! You're fleeing Honduras? Why not try El Salvador?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15316.wav|admit them to safety first.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15317.wav|then came up with...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15318.wav|as a great success.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15319.wav|And I am not saying that he is the perfect candidate.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15321.wav|"Whew! That was a close one. I got a bit worried
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15323.wav|for your religion that would actually be a big help.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15324.wav|available to them?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15325.wav|nothing to do with immigration.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15326.wav|especially considering that our immigration policy
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15327.wav|that nothing could be further from the truth.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15328.wav|within the first six months of the administration.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15329.wav|Yeah. The government,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15330.wav|not leave them in there while you convene a hearing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15333.wav|they're now trying to make this damage permanent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15335.wav|like the one Joe Biden was in for eight years.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15336.wav|if they live in a narco state.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15338.wav|Yeah, Mark. We're aware that you keep saying that this has
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15339.wav|has touted it using a pretty weird metric.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15340.wav|So a person not showing up in court,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15342.wav|There is actually one thing that you can do.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15343.wav|in hotels supervised by private contractors.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15344.wav|is the Hampton fucking Inn.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15345.wav|Since, for many migrants,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15346.wav|or scheduled hearings for when the courts aren't open,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15347.wav|who fled Honduras after MS- gang members tried to force
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15348.wav|a photo-perfect David Bowie.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15349.wav|how it's supposed to work, and just a few of the key ways
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15350.wav|Once, when an outbreak of mumps

../../input/johnoliver/wav/15353.wav|I personally find his opposition to Medicare for all
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15354.wav|before you get to what happened earlier this year,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15355.wav|Or, as they're more commonly known,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15356.wav|And I know that those aren't adjectives you're used to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15357.wav|Now, we've talked about immigration repeatedly
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15358.wav|And incidentally, the rest of that wish list
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15359.wav|from those that they expect of having family in the U.S.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15360.wav|nor is it responsible for,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15361.wav|that Miller crafted
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15362.wav|after you've forced them to wait in a dangerous area
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15363.wav|asylum capacity.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15364.wav|of thousands of families for who this scrap
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15365.wav|so she and her granddaughter fled to the U.S.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15366.wav|has basically created a shadow deportation system
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15369.wav|in some places the migrants themselves
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15370.wav|holding documentation that you were murdered
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15371.wav|And for the record, the government can make
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15372.wav|And they have used this a lot.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15374.wav|another cruel, calculated decision that has largely flown
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15375.wav|even allowed to ask for asylum at the border each day,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15377.wav|Let's start with how it's supposed to work at our border.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15378.wav|asylum seekers who've already made it into the U.S.

../../input/johnoliver/wav/15382.wav|If you ask the cops for help and they responded by
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15383.wav|But for some many, especially now,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15384.wav|They're the thing that you are so obsessed with
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15385.wav|One immigration attorney that we spoke with has said...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15386.wav|Because of course they do.

../../input/johnoliver/wav/15398.wav|I kind of wanted him to keep going.

../../input/johnoliver/wav/15412.wav|Barr should've done more to punish his political enemies,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15413.wav|that said the FBI could seize a suspect abroad
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15414.wav|that turns on the left, and that is Wallace Shawn.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15416.wav|his exact views on consent.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15417.wav|Now, since becoming AG,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15418.wav|permitting violence and destruction of property
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15419.wav|"One time, I licked the boot of the state so hard,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15422.wav|If there ever is real anarchy,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15424.wav|It's well-targeted, fully justified fury at,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15427.wav|but at its core, "I wish that white nationalist

../../input/johnoliver/wav/15431.wav|Now, did that tell us anything about Barr, aside from the fact
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15436.wav|And as much as he may think that he's the only objective,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15438.wav|Maybe she didn't say go do it, but her attitude was definitely "Get it done."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15439.wav|Much like slaves did when, and this is true,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15441.wav|it won't be poor people getting shot.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15442.wav|isn't bad simply a noise to which we have ascribed meaning?

../../input/johnoliver/wav/15444.wav|"Carry a big stick and speak loudly about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15445.wav|of a masculine toilet for the well-endowed.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15447.wav|So much so, that he brought police coffee
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15448.wav|Trump's Attorney General, and constipated Charmin Bear.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15449.wav|In just the past few months, he has, among other things,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15450.wav|actually a little more hesitant, telling him, "I don't want
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15451.wav|and at one point tried to have the U.S. government replace
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15452.wav|instead of cultivating any meaningful relationships!
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15453.wav|Because he is a fervent believer in something known as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15454.wav|of Barr's direct orders or just his general attitude,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15456.wav|He's from New York, and fun fact,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15457.wav|And not just that, he also supported the pardon
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15458.wav|He once said in an attack on the liberalism of the 's...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15459.wav|So yeah, by that standard, Barr was the adult in the room.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15460.wav|Barr is Trump's dream AG.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15461.wav|the foreign state's consent.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15462.wav|which I have to admit is pretty cool of him.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15463.wav|Here is his old boss, at Barr's swearing in,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15464.wav|as if he needed to get any hotter.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15465.wav|virtually complete and total executive power.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15468.wav|But from a purely objective standpoint,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15469.wav|inspiring college stories about how you burnt
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15470.wav|which places "no limit on the president's authority
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15471.wav|Let's put it this way.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15472.wav|Did we have to show you anyway? Absolutely, because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15474.wav|of Mueller's report weeks before making it publicly available.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15475.wav|And in that sense, specifically the th century sense,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15477.wav|As Teddy Roosevelt once said,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15478.wav|So, Barr didn't really get a chance to fully test
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15479.wav|which says they are made with a chemical irritant
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15480.wav|and late last year, seemed to threaten communities
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15481.wav|So, he presented himself as a strong proponent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15482.wav|the veneer of seasoned legal analysis,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15483.wav|And some go further, arguing that the mainstream
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15484.wav|Pepper balls are made with a chemical irritant.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15485.wav|especially when it comes to criminal justice.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15486.wav|who accused him of rape was quote, "Not my type."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15487.wav|who, even though she's pre-verbal,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15488.wav|onto the rest of the country, and it is uncompromising.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15490.wav|At his core, Barr is clearly the same kid who took
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15491.wav|But Barr goes even further than that,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15493.wav|Barr's embrace of the Unitary Executive Theory
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15494.wav|you stretching-- I think the way to advance executive power
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15495.wav|Uh, bad. It means bad. Babies and dogs know that.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15496.wav|as an absolute hard line on immigration,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15497.wav|how softly you speak about what a big stick you're carrying."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15498.wav|fair-minded man left in government,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15499.wav|as they encountered protestors.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15500.wav|But he has gone even further than sanctioning pepper balls,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15501.wav|It's a vocal noise and nothing more.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15502.wav|with potentially massive implications.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15505.wav|And sense then, his DOJ has suggested a lighter sentence
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15506.wav|Hey, everyone! Please welcome Bill,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15507.wav|And at this point, it's probably worth pausing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15508.wav|in the middle of a pandemic in the grossest possible way.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15509.wav|He has the right to do whatever he wants,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15510.wav|And the thing is if you strip
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15511.wav|Barr went to great lengths to make it seem palatable.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15512.wav|who even dared to protest against the police.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15513.wav|without Congress's consent, to writing a legal opinion
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15515.wav|for Roger Stone, is trying to drop the charges
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15516.wav|the Queen played in Diana's death.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15517.wav|and yet Barr refused Congress's request
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15518.wav|arising from Trump's statement that a woman
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15519.wav|more dangerous going forward.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15520.wav|and then, for a few crazy months,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15521.wav|"corruptly" actually means.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15523.wav|And what is particularly striking about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15524.wav|But you can kind of see why people were so willing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15526.wav|the legal authority to wage war against Iraq,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15527.wav|using boring but smart sounding legalese to cover up
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15528.wav|And in it, Barr argued that...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15529.wav|Barr sees a country that needs to be whipped
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15530.wav|That is clearly unbelievably weaselly,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15531.wav|Because it would violate Article Two of the Constitution,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15532.wav|some key exceptions when it came to his own bosses.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15533.wav|So tonight, let's talk about Bill Barr.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15534.wav|while "letting out a big laugh."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15535.wav|Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15536.wav|Okay.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15537.wav|When protests erupted this summer in the wake
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15538.wav|because one, they work for us, and two, they work for us.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15539.wav|At Columbia University in the anti-war 's,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15540.wav|Because that is what we're all looking for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15541.wav|as a child, he was a little narc who devoted himself
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15542.wav|It's Thirsty Thursday, bitches. Time to pep, pep, pep it up.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15544.wav|to appoint an independent council.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15545.wav|Although, he wouldn't like me even bringing this up.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15546.wav|check and balance each other, is wrong.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15547.wav|But that is clearly not the point here.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15548.wav|He famously provided an exculpatory summary
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15549.wav|and having a view of criminal justice,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15550.wav|is that it takes a lot of breath to explain just how wrong
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15551.wav|That phrase is doing a lot of heavy lifting there.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15553.wav|criticizing the Mueller investigation,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15554.wav|And that is just sad.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15555.wav|Barr has been in the news constantly,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15556.wav|Barr blames what he sees as society's ills on moral decay.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15557.wav|anytime we have footage
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15558.wav|No, it didn't.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15559.wav|with sedition...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15562.wav|of the subject of one of our stories
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15563.wav|the racist goblin formerly known as Jeff Sessions
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15564.wav|allowed to be a tyrant."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15566.wav|But the reason people breathlessly attack
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15567.wav|Barr isn't just fighting to give the president power on principle.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15568.wav|against Michael Flynn, who remember,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15569.wav|But he is also very much more. He is a driven,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15571.wav|and adds an apt descriptor.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15576.wav|all that rhetorical bluster away,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15577.wav|executive power. From advising Bush that he had
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15578.wav|Now, veneration of authority has been a consistent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15579.wav|had plead guilty,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15580.wav|they were literal slaves.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15581.wav|that provides versatility for any situation.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15582.wav|playing the bagpipes, we will show you a clip of that.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15585.wav|Trump as the defendant in a defamation suit
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15586.wav|but I will say I am glad someone finally found
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15588.wav|He is clearly splitting hairs with the word "chemical" there,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15589.wav|when Trump first nominated him, the news was basically greeted
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15590.wav|with extreme views on executive power,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15591.wav|But regardless of whether that operation was a result
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15592.wav|that has the fucking Supreme Court on its side,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15593.wav|is to wait and see, move gradually."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15595.wav|that systemic racism in police departments does not exist,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15596.wav|to make sure that this president can whip freely.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15597.wav|should be through the election process
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15598.wav|he made his support for it afterwards very clear.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15601.wav|Anyway, that is why I think the president should be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15604.wav|a noisy sex doll for octopuses?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15607.wav|sown distrust in mail-in voting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15608.wav|that a moral order must be imposed and by force.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15609.wav|opens his hot little mouth.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15610.wav|Although, interestingly, that philosophy had
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15611.wav|which is pretty startling 'cause that interpretation
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15612.wav|We're so glad to have Bill onboard.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15614.wav|Barr has been relentless.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15615.wav|What a weird thing to share on someone's first day
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15616.wav|is that he is childish.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15617.wav|perhaps best summed up by a memo that the DOJ produced,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15618.wav|of a creepy uncle trying to interact with his baby niece,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15619.wav|he topped it off with a "Wah!"
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15620.wav|for a moment to talk about the basis
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15621.wav|at his disposal, and he has been willing to use it.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15622.wav|And protests against police brutality
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15623.wav|And that's not just a promise, that's a bagpipe promise.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15625.wav|the argument you're basically left with is this...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15627.wav|You can just check the website of the company
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15628.wav|Very basically, the theory holds that the president has
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15629.wav|And let's immediately answer the question
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15631.wav|of six defendants in the Iran-Contra scandal.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15635.wav|And, ultimately, that is why he is so very, very dangerous.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15636.wav|It's what leadership is all about.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15638.wav|signing off on a mass-surveillance program,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15639.wav|but he doesn't even talk about it,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15640.wav|he stood out for being incredibly pro-law enforcement.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15642.wav|over its own domain."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15644.wav|but he's also entirely fucking wrong.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15645.wav|caused by a mismanaged pandemic
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15646.wav|understanding of the separation of powers,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15647.wav|of sliding into Trump's DMs.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15650.wav|is, as always, add a statement lip,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15651.wav|that's undoubtably top of your mind,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15652.wav|and dangerous it is.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15653.wav|Matthew Whitaker, a man who was once involved in a scandal
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15654.wav|sharing a fun anecdote from his childhood.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15655.wav|"What does bad mean? What does any word mean?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15658.wav|he was simply a nightmare.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15659.wav|So, you can see why some would argue that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15660.wav|from day to night. And the answer there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15661.wav|with Barr saying...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15662.wav|to interfere with matters that concern his own conduct."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15663.wav|So, it's frankly not surprising that at just age,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15664.wav|He wants to give this president power,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15665.wav|in black and brown communities during an economic downturn
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15666.wav|then there is only one way to breathlessly describe that.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15669.wav|those same communities is not anarchy.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15673.wav|Yeah, that's not how it should work, Bill.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15674.wav|You not only belittled an extremely reasonable legal concern,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15675.wav|already knows this guy is bad news.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15676.wav|he is bolstering his and the president's case
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15677.wav|actually making him one of the more dangerous figures
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15678.wav|to an unhealthy worship of authority
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15679.wav|titled, "The Case For More Incarceration."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15680.wav|Look, not only is being an adult an absurdly low bar to set
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15681.wav|Now, that is an extreme interpretation of the law
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15682.wav|of pseudo-intellectual nonsense there.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15685.wav|gives the president an enormous amount of leeway.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15686.wav|But that is almost an impressive amount
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15688.wav|And time has not moderated his views,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15689.wav|He's a socialist,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15690.wav|"Do you have a clip of Bill Barr playing the bagpipes?"
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15691.wav|Yeah, that was a major scandal at the time,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15692.wav|and return them to the US without first obtaining
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15693.wav|Nationalize my healthcare, you soft boiled egg.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15694.wav|All of which is definitely what the founders had in mind
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15695.wav|He gives radically conservative views,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15696.wav|So, his "Cover-Up General" nickname is really pretty fair,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15697.wav|for a lot of Barr's actions.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15698.wav|who Barr thinks are ruining society.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15699.wav|"a different kind of restraint."
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15700.wav|You're supposedly to tell your grandkids fun,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15701.wav|Oh, come on, Bill. That's just ridiculous.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15703.wav|once arguing that the only checks on the president
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15705.wav|the Unitary Executive Theory.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15706.wav|a hundred different reasons, but do spare a thought there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15707.wav|as anarchist jurisdictions because they were
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15708.wav|Although, as Barr tells it, George H. W. Bush was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15709.wav|Trump may also be Barr's dream president.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15710.wav|blamed for exactly that since Barr was beating up hippies
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15711.wav|The point is that by Barr even saying that,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15712.wav|And I know that it makes for a fun balloon now and again,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15713.wav|a chance to push his uncompromising moral vision
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15714.wav|your draft card or went streaking across campus.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15715.wav|But Barr's wild tale seemed to be more like,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15716.wav|and also dismissed public health measures
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15717.wav|Someone who is...
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15718.wav|Okay.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15719.wav|so much joy in beating up protestors at Columbia.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15720.wav|with an authoritarian streak would act his age"
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15721.wav|in that it takes something that he is, Attorney General,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15722.wav|'Cause he's Secretary of The Treasury,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15723.wav|And he once got into a fist fight with students
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15724.wav|Adult in the room?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15725.wav|in our projectile weapons versatility,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15726.wav|and giving coffee to cops.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15727.wav|which I know is saying something.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15728.wav|deeply moralistic man
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15730.wav|is Secretary Sprinkler. Why?
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15731.wav|when it comes to playing defense for Trump,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15732.wav|is sort of missing the point here.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15733.wav|as Attorney General under George H.W. Bush,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15734.wav|or the impeachment process, and that is it,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15735.wav|that has disproportionately ravaged
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15736.wav|who were demonstrating on campus,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15737.wav|Barr has made it very clear what battle he is really fighting
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15739.wav|after quickly climbing the ranks of the DOJ,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15743.wav|Coincidentally, the same people the Republican politicians have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15744.wav|if Bill Barr has anything to say about it.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15745.wav|Barr's extreme behavior over the last year and a half is that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15746.wav|that the three coequal branches of government
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15747.wav|And Barr is very much one of them.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15748.wav|telling federal prosecutors to consider charging writers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15749.wav|into shape and is doing everything he can
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15751.wav|to borrow a phrase, a lack of safety for the citizenry.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15752.wav|And who would have thought that just years later,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15753.wav|a way to transition this civil violation
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15754.wav|of George Floyd's murder, he repeatedly said
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15755.wav|And while Trump has been grumbling lately that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15757.wav|And if Trump is re-elected and Barr is given a chance
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15758.wav|And instead, that "each branch has near-total authority
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15759.wav|to learn literally any musical instrument,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15761.wav|and who he is fighting it against.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15762.wav|a bat shit proposition.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15763.wav|Bad is a human construct.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15764.wav|And not just that 'cause Trump may also give Barr
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15765.wav|At one point, he employed one of his signature moves,
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15766.wav|so he at least knew what the job involved.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15767.wav|that he's the kind of guy who, given the option
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15768.wav|ditch the blazer, and change those flats to pumps.
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15769.wav|But if Trump gets a second term, Barr is only going to be

../../input/johnoliver/wav/15771.wav|sued John Bolton to try and stop the release of his book,

../../input/johnoliver/wav/15902.wav|mistakenly thinking that a patient wrote

../../input/johnoliver/wav/15909.wav|forceps it suggests things have gone

../../input/johnoliver/wav/15926.wav|what you do because many part-time
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15927.wav|something similar
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15929.wav|make sure that people getting benefits

../../input/johnoliver/wav/15943.wav|work is eligible generally

../../input/johnoliver/wav/15959.wav|at a penalty which is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15962.wav|the lowest in the country and less than
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15964.wav|the result of deliberate choices
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15966.wav|schools do seem decent but before i go

../../input/johnoliver/wav/15971.wav|quit voluntarily or who were fired are
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15972.wav|okay he made a very confident public
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15974.wav|right that is just not a name
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15975.wav|rolled out an expensive new claim system
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15977.wav|what he clearly thought was a pretty

../../input/johnoliver/wav/15988.wav|she's taking care of herself and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15989.wav|so how did our system get this shitty
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15990.wav|something that became painfully clear
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15993.wav|seen florida started requiring that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15995.wav|if we are not going to federalize and at

../../input/johnoliver/wav/15997.wav|benefits that they need
../../input/johnoliver/wav/15999.wav|what do you even think this white void
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16000.wav|make an unemployment claim but that

../../input/johnoliver/wav/16004.wav|and to balance those cuts out as scott
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16005.wav|terrible oh never mind we're clapping
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16006.wav|you're out of luck and the problem
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16007.wav|proof that nothing good can ever come
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16008.wav|took a hatchet to the states program
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16009.wav|stop states from being able to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16011.wav|know you're in good hands when a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16012.wav|you're thinking hey what's so bad about
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16013.wav|but something that the lieutenant
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16014.wav|so clearly meant to impede access the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16016.wav|auditors had flagged problems with

../../input/johnoliver/wav/16032.wav|has been broken for years now and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16033.wav|because if we don't fix it

../../input/johnoliver/wav/16037.wav|only one is actually receiving benefits

../../input/johnoliver/wav/16053.wav|tens of millions of people lost their

../../input/johnoliver/wav/16061.wav|make up a significant portion
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16062.wav|they were paying just per employee

../../input/johnoliver/wav/16071.wav|accurately critique this it'd be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16072.wav|because if a claim

../../input/johnoliver/wav/16089.wav|it is a mistake to think of this merely
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16090.wav|that only one in seats had an oxygen

../../input/johnoliver/wav/16107.wav|taking a civil service exam

../../input/johnoliver/wav/16125.wav|this time last year when it was

../../input/johnoliver/wav/16141.wav|you'll figure out a way to eat well

../../input/johnoliver/wav/16239.wav|quick shout out to elmo's mom there
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16241.wav|florida's system in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16242.wav|emergency crematorium or elephant
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16243.wav|we were at just and in some states
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16244.wav|and deliberate neglect of its
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16246.wav|has become pretty popular your most
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16248.wav|percent
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16249.wav|that unemployment insurance is actually
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16250.wav|recipiency rate should be around
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16254.wav|those type of jobs just as
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16255.wav|state antiquated systems were simply
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16256.wav|a requirement for applying for
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16257.wav|that they get oh yeah don't worry that's
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16259.wav|by as much as two dollars so it's a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16261.wav|as a technological problem
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16262.wav|that they would be fixed they pretty
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16264.wav|be better for the broader economy and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16265.wav|social program
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16267.wav|so given that tonight let's look at our
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16268.wav|desantis administrations
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16269.wav|is not definitely no yet but the truth
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16270.wav|while in power when he was sworn in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16272.wav|and has massive macroeconomic benefits
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16273.wav|over the past decade
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16274.wav|many states aggressive policy changes
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16275.wav|this country because
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16276.wav|tend not to hoard it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16277.wav|no one could be called tupac shakur
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16279.wav|like those fresh out of school or who
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16280.wav|states needed to restore them but rather
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16281.wav|deep benefit cuts and absurd eligibility
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16282.wav|and it's a testament to both this
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16284.wav|probably to a waitress at red lobster
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16285.wav|offshore in the caymans they spend it on
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16287.wav|a bad idea states do lose money to fraud
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16288.wav|raise taxes to get more money coming in
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16289.wav|much credit there it is worth knowing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16290.wav|it wasn't honestly a lot an average of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16291.wav|is each additional requirement
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16292.wav|fear and insecurity economists generally
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16294.wav|which is absurd given that those jobs
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16295.wav|congress should at the very least be
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16299.wav|post a shelfie on the gram what are your
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16301.wav|for one remember businesses fund
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16302.wav|than separate ones so we should
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16303.wav|independent contractors and gig workers
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16304.wav|well his name is kendall so
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16305.wav|each state plus
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16306.wav|someone's going to make a mistake
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16307.wav|required to repay their benefits
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16308.wav|this state let me
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16310.wav|rolled out a new system in which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16311.wav|deserve payments don't get them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16312.wav|opportunities for you to apply for that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16313.wav|i think you know what's coming next now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16314.wav|that's how you get macklemore and if
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16315.wav|also forced everyone to file online and
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16316.wav|for recovering from a recession which
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16318.wav|lies enough to warrant a
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16319.wav|unemployment system
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16320.wav|essentially have
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16323.wav|after the flaws of this system have been
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16324.wav|like north carolina and florida it was
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16325.wav|non-puppet population
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16326.wav|can come together to break a vital
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16327.wav|bigger scale michigan
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16328.wav|fast about things this depressing
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16329.wav|california alone said it lost
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16330.wav|the word recoup there is it sounds kind
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16331.wav|some in the national media cheered them
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16332.wav|it's only a matter of time the point is
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16333.wav|wow i gotta say it's kind of weird to
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16334.wav|dollars per
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16335.wav|the moment it seems like we're not
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16336.wav|whole different set of problems
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16337.wav|proudly told a conference of young
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16338.wav|and scrambling to make sure that the
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16339.wav|actually receive benefits now
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16341.wav|there's a reason that famines aren't
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16342.wav|because the system underneath that
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16343.wav|year they had to suddenly shift to paper
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16345.wav|absolutely happen to me if at t
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16346.wav|let me just google if i lose my job will
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16347.wav|thing is how completely preventable it
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16348.wav|based on minstrel shows this toddler
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16350.wav|to get unemployment and even if you do
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16351.wav|applications for suitable work but
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16352.wav|and it wasn't just tennessee lots of
../../input/johnoliver/wav/16353.wav|having to call times a day just to
